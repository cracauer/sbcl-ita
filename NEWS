changes relative to sbcl-1.3.8:
  * enhancement: cached make-instance/allocate-instance constructors can now
    get garbage collected. 
  * optimization: better performance for some unoptimized operations on
    complex numbers.
  * bug fix: using the options :LOCAL-NICKNAMES and :LOCK in the same
    DEFPACKAGE form no longer signals a bogus error

changes in sbcl-1.3.8 relative to sbcl-1.3.7:
  * minor incompatible change: the system now understands that the CONDITION
    type is disjoint with many other system types.
  * minor incompatible change: argument types in condition report functions
    are now declared (in combination with the above change, this can result in
    early detection of erroneous code).
  * enhancement: simple arrays of any rank can be stack-allocated
    on platforms supporting stack allocation of vectors.
  * optimization: improved type derivation for FIND, POSITION, COUNT, SEARCH,
    MISMATCH and other array and sequence functions.
  * optimization: ALLOCATE-INSTANCE is now as fast as MAKE-INSTANCE.
  * optimization: more efficient CHANGE-CLASS.
  * bug fix: versions of getresuid() and getresgid() in SB-POSIX no longer
    cause memory faults, and should work properly (lp#1603806, reported by
    Kieran Grant)
  * bug fix: handle ENOENT from getprotobyname() (lp#1596043, reported by
    Stephen Hassard)

changes in sbcl-1.3.7 relative to sbcl-1.3.6:
  * bug fix: preserve the name of the destructive function for the destroyed
    constant and important result warnings, even when declared NOTINLINE.
  * optimization: faster operations on list-sets.

changes in sbcl-1.3.6 relative to sbcl-1.3.5:
  * bug fix: do not insert conditional newlines in print-unreadable-object
    (lp#1398290). This reverses a change made in lp#488979 which reversed
    a fix advertised in release 0.8.14 to pass the GCL ANSI Test Suite.
  * bug fix: constant negative rotations of 32-bit quantities are compiled
    correctly on x86-64 and arm.  (lp#1586614, reported by Guillaume Le
    Vaillant)

changes in sbcl-1.3.5 relative to sbcl-1.3.4:
  * enhancement: the platform's strtod() is exposed as SB-POSIX:STRTOD

    Hlavaty)

changes in sbcl-1.3.4 relative to sbcl-1.3.3:
  * enhancement: who-sets and who-references work on DEFGLOBAL. (lp#1552997)
  * enhancement: CONSTANTP understands backquote.
    e.g. (CONSTANTP '`(0 (,CHAR-CODE-LIMIT))) => T
  * optimization: improvements to sequence functions: CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE,
    REVERSE.
  * bug fix: SB-EVAL does not signal an error for (THE KEYWORD :FOO)
  * bug fix: a DEFTYPE name that is redefined into a DEFSTRUCT name
    is less likely to cause confusion in the compiler.
  * bug fix: DOCUMENTATION works as intended for classes with non-standard
    metaclasses
  * bug fix: (TYPEP <extended-sequence> <extended-sequence-class>) no longer
    returns NIL in certain situations
  * bug fix: MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAP, CONCATENATE and MERGE accept class objects as
    result-type
  * bug fix: MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAP, CONCATENATE and MERGE expand DEFTYPEs in
    result-type

changes in sbcl-1.3.3 relative to sbcl-1.3.2:
  * enhancement: warn about argument mismatch for functions passed as
    arguments to other functions (e.g. REDUCE, MAP) at compile-time.
  * optimization: functions accepting other functions (e.g. REDUCE, FIND) can
    now be constant-folded if all function arguments are declared as foldable.
  * optimization: improved logical operations on integers of unknown type.
  * bug fix: exception handling no longer leaks memory on OS X. (lp#326238)

changes in sbcl-1.3.2 relative to sbcl-1.3.1:
  * enhancement: {READ,WRITE}-SEQUENCE are much faster for some combinations
    of short sequences and stream types
  * enhancement: MAKE-LIST's result can be stack-allocated on x86-64
  * bug fix: WRITE-SEQUENCE no longer fails to write lists containing integers
    to bivalent streams
  * bug fix: LOGTEST (and hence ODDP) no longer conses when given fixnum
    arguments and small bit positions.  (lp#1277690)
  * bug fix: READ-FROM-STRING compiler-macro does not permute its arguments
  * bug fix: DEFUN of a function name that collides with a system-generated
    structure accessor does not confuse the runtime. (lp#540063)
  * bug fix: heap corruption from miscompiled RESTART-BIND. (lp#1530390)

changes in sbcl-1.3.1 relative to sbcl-1.3.0:
  * enhancement: SB-THREAD support for ARM64.
  * enhancement: compiling an out-of-line DEFSTRUCT constructor call
    will warn if a defaulted value is incompatible with its slot type.
  * enhancement: a local INLINE declaration on a structure constructor
    will work as intended, subject to any other factors that inhibit
    inlining, even if the DEFSTRUCT was not itself within a global
    INLINE proclamation for the named constructor
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:DYNAMIC-SPACE-SIZE is now defined for cheneygc.
  * enhancement: x86[-64] platforms support SB-EXT:CAS on structure slots
    of type SB-EXT:WORD
  * enhancement: the interleaved structure slot optimization from
    release 1.2.6 has been ported to 32-bit x86, Sparc, PowerPC, ARM64.
  * enhancement: SB-THREAD:JOIN-THREAD signals a proper error when an attempt
    is made to join the current thread
  * bug fix: NTH-VALUE does not cause stack overflow. (lp#1511419)
  * bug fix: structure constructor type checking is better. (lp#1508735)
  * bug fix: supplied-p variables for unused optional or keyword variables no
    longer confuse SB-DI:PARSE-COMPILED-DEBUG-FUN-LAMBDA-LIST (and thus the
    backtrace machinery) (lp#1498644)
  * bug fix: Backtrace correctly handles undefined-function frames on MIPS.
  * bug fix: WITH-FLOAT-TRAPS-MASKED correctly clears accrued traps on MIPS
    (fixes issues with floating-point type derivation in the compiler).
  * bug fix: FLOAT-NAN-P and FLOAT-TRAPPING-NAN-P now work correctly on MIPS
    and HPPA.
  * bug fix: MIPS context register access now masks to 32 bits (fixing issues
    parsing negative-fixnum values for internal-error arguments and escaped
    debug variables on 64-bit CPUs).
  * bug fix: (SETF SAP-REF-DOUBLE) with constant offset on big-endian MIPS
    now works correctly.
  * bug fix: Callback parameter (argument) handling on MIPS is now vastly
    more correct.
  * bug fix: %DECREMENT-SEMAPHORE adjusts the remaining timeout after a
    spurious wakeup

changes in sbcl-1.3.0 relative to sbcl-1.2.16:
  * minor incompatible change: the environment passed to a macro/setf/deftype
    expander is not always an object of type SB-KERNEL:LEXENV.
    It can be nil, as is permissible by the standard.
  * enhancement: ported to ARM64 Linux.
  * enhancement: a new interpreter is included which has many benefits
    over sb-eval. It is disabled by default. See src/interpreter/README
    for instructions to enable it, and further details.
  * bug fix: calling COMPILE when SB-EXT:*EVALUATOR-MODE* was :INTERPRET
    would fail to perform "normal semantic processing such as macro expansion"
    as stipulated by X3J13 issue LOAD-TIME-EVAL.
  * bug fix: SB-UNICODE:CONFUSABLE-P no longer treats "<" and the empty
    string as confusable.  (lp#1504739)
  * bug fix: (ASSERT (COMPUTE-IT ...)) would expand incorrectly
    if COMPUTE-IT was a local macro that shadowed a global function.
  * bug fix: SB-POSIX:CFSETISPEED and SB-POSIX:CFSETOSPEED now work properly
    on platforms that use only the minimum specified set of fields in struct
    termios (verified on Linux, still known not to work on FreeBSD and NetBSD,
    very probably others).  (partial fix for lp#1500951)

changes in sbcl-1.2.16 relative to sbcl-1.2.15:
  * enhancement: by default, timers with a repeat interval do not "catch up"
    by repeatedly calling their function after a clock discontinuity such as a
    suspend and resume cycle
  * bug fix: correctly restore multiple values on the stack in the presence of
    alien calls. (lp#1489590)
  * bug fix: MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM enforces that :ELEMENT-TYPE
    is a subtype of CHARACTER.
  * bug fix: an EQL method specializer no longer causes garbage retention
    if there are no extant methods using the specializer. (lp#492851)

changes in sbcl-1.2.15 relative to sbcl-1.2.14:
  * new feature: DEPRECATION declaration for functions, variables and types
    causes {EARLY,LATE,FINAL}-DEPRECATION-WARNING to be signaled when subject
    of the declaration is used. Integrated with DESCRIBE, DOCUMENTATION and
    SB-CLTL2:{VARIABLE,FUNCTION}-INFORMATION. Documented in the "Deprecation"
    section of the manual.
  * enhancement: ASDF updated to 3.1.5. (lp#1476867)
  * enhancement: definitions within PROGN get proper source locations when
    compiled (needs latest Slime to take advantage of this). (lp#1473147)
  * enhancement: source locations for DEFCLASS slots now point directly to the
    slot definitions, not the whole DEFCLASS form.
  * bug fix: better source location in the presence of quoted forms.
    (lp#1370561)
  * bug fix: better source locations inside backqoute. (lp#1361502)
  * bug fix: HANDLER-BIND requires that the handler-function be
    a function designator at the time of binding establishment. (lp#1480679)
  * bug fix: inlined functions surrounded by nested macrolets are properly
    inlined. (lp#309123)

changes in sbcl-1.2.14 relative to sbcl-1.2.13:
  * minor incompatible change: The name of a compiled anonymous lambda
    as returned by the third value of FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION can have
    a lambda-list-like list following the introductory LAMBDA that is not
    in general a syntactically valid lambda list. Specifically, it won't
    retain default values, supplied-p variables, or &KEY or &AUX bindings.
  * enhancement: DESTRUCTURING-BIND has been totally reimplemented from
    scratch to address a handful of performance and correctness issues.
    Some minor behavioral differences exist regarding order of evaluation
    of default forms for unsupplied &OPTIONAL and &KEY arguments
    when nested destructuring patterns are involved.
    (lp#707556, lp#707573, lp#707578, lp#708051)
  * enhancement: DEFCONSTANT and DEFSTRUCT respect package locks. (lp#1186238,
    lp#1036716)
  * enhancement: sb-unicode:normalize-string has a new optional argument,
    FILTER, a callback which controls which decomposed characters are
    collected. Useful for stripping away diacritics more efficiently.
  * bug fix: (TYPE-OF ARRAY) for a non-simple array is subject to change
    after a call of ADJUST-ARRAY. (lp#1333731)
  * bug fix: Dynamic-extent allocation with a loop between allocating a value
    and the start of its environment no longer discards the allocated data
    when the loop is taken. (lp#1472785)
  * bug fix: Variable-reference elimination no longer generates incorrect code
    under certain circumstances. (lp#1446891)
  * bug fix: variables with EQL types are no longer treated as constants by
    VOPs, which caused problems with closures being allocated for such
    variables, but they remained unused. (lp#1390149)
  * bug fix: Windows installer generates registry key name
    correctly. (lp#1476447)

changes in sbcl-1.2.13 relative to sbcl-1.2.12:
  * incompatible change: on success, TRY-SEMAPHORE and WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE
    return the new count
  * enhancement: WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE accepts a decrement parameter
  * enhancement: JOIN-THREAD allows distinguishing timeout vs. abort in all
    situations
  * enhancement: On Windows DBG_PRINTEXCEPTION_C is handled and its message is
    printed. (lp#1437947)
  * bug-fix: TRUENAME works properly on broken symlinks presented as
    directories. (lp#1400003)
  * bug fix: Inlined DPB and DEPOSIT-FIELD don't interfere with left-to-right
    order of argument evaluation. (lp#1458190)
  * bug fix: (SETF (LDB (BYTE 1 2 JUNK) X) 0) is rightly rejected.
  * bug fix: DEFSETF lambda lists should not permit argument destructuring.
  * bug fix: calls to (SETF SLOT-VALUE) on a missing slot would in certain
    situations incorrectly return the result of a SLOT-MISSING method
    instead of always returning the new value. (lp#1460381)
  * bug fix: a DEFMACRO occurring not at toplevel and capturing parts of
    its lexical environment (thus being a closure) caused expressions
    involving the macro name to cause corruption in the pretty-printer
    due to faulty introspection of the lambda list of a closure.
  * bug fix: out of line MAP/MAP-INTO check that the results produced by the
    function are of the matching sequence type. (lp#1459581)
  * bug fix: pretty-printing of '(LET `((,X ,Y)) :B) is handled correctly.

changes in sbcl-1.2.12 relative to sbcl-1.2.11:
  * minor incompatible change: the SB-C::*POLICY* variable is no longer
    a list. Code which manipulated it as such (including but not limited
    to non-bundled releases of ASDF) will need to be revised.
  * enhancement: The input stream for COMPILE-FILE implements
    STREAM-LINE-COLUMN.
  * enhancement: EVAL errors that occur by way of LOAD report the starting
    line and column number of the erring toplevel form. (lp#565247)
  * optimization: better MAP and MAP-INTO on known vector result types.
  * bug fix: Read/modify/write macros accessing a place which is a
    composition of CAR+CDR operations, such as (SHIFTF (CADR X) (ELT V 0)),
    do not access subforms more than once. (lp#1450968)
  * bug fix: short form of DEFSETF no longer allows trailing junk.
  * bug fix: DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO respects the provisions of CLHS 5.1.3
    regarding argument evaluation order. (lp#1452539)
  * bug fix: POP works as specified in CLHS if the setter for its
    argument has a side-effect on the existing CAR value. (lp#1454021)
  * bug fix: Reading "#()" with a positive numeric argument signals a
    reader error. As specified, reading "#1()" has undefined consequences,
    so correct portable code should be indifferent to this. (lp#1252100)
  * bug fix: Malformed reader conditionals such as "(#-no-such-feature)"
    and "(#+sbcl)" no longer parse as NIL. (lp#1454400)

changes in sbcl-1.2.11 relative to sbcl-1.2.10:
  * enhancement: SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH will warn when given an expression in
    which any part is unrecognizable as a legal type-specifier.
    The dispatch table will be altered, but the new entry is disabled.
    Subsequent type-defining forms will cause pprint-dispatch tables to
    re-examine whether any disabled entries should be enabled. (lp#1429520)
  * enhancement: Loading code containing calls to a deprecated function will,
    under most circumstances, signal warnings similar to compiling such code.
    The usual caveat holds about not detecting calls through a computed name,
    as in (funcall (intern "DEPRECATED-FUN" "SB-EXT")).
  * enhancement: (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-LINE) is a new macro that expands
    to a constant (VALUES integer integer) indicating the source line/column
    from which it was read, intended for logging Lisp runtime errors in
    a style similar to that afforded by the C preprocessor __LINE__ macro.
    Similarly (SB-EXT:COMPILE-FILE-POSITION) returns a position in characters.
  * enhancement: improved source locations for VOPs, alien types and
    declarations.
  * bug fix: functions in :FINAL deprecation have the correct docstring.
    No visible change, as no such functions presently exist. (lp#1439151)
  * bug fix: (SETF (FDEFINITION this) (FDEFINITION OTHER)) signals an error
    if OTHER names either a macro or special-operator. (lp#1439921)

changes in sbcl-1.2.10 relative to sbcl-1.2.9:
  * minor incompatible change: all SOCKINT::WIN32-* functions have been
    deprecated with EARLY deprecation state
  * minor incompatible change: performing introspection via the system-internal
    SB-INT:INFO function could expose that :TYPE :TRANSLATOR is not necessarily
    a function, as it always was before. (Affects swank-fancy-inspector)
  * enhancement: The value of SXHASH on bit-vectors of length equal to the
    word size now depends on the vector's contents instead of being constant;
    its value on bit-vectors of length divisible by the word size now depends
    also on the contents of the vector's last word.
  * bug-fix: sb-bsd-sockets on win32 uses proper C function declarations.
    (lp#1426667)
  * bug fix: A new dead code elimination phase removes dead code loops
    that confuse stack analysis. (lp#1255782, lp#308914)
  * bug fix: A toplevel form which was simple enough to bypass the main
    compiler in COMPILE-FILE, and which contained an empty SETQ or PROGN
    would produce an invalid fasl file. (lp#1427050)
  * bug fix: The compiler no longer signals an internal error when
    encountering invalid FUNCTION forms like (function 1)
  * bug fix: express proper dependencies in the ASDF contrib, to support
    systems where make runs in parallel.  (lp#1434768; thanks to Nikhil
    Benesch)

changes in sbcl-1.2.9 relative to sbcl-1.2.8:
  * minor incompatible change and bug fix: unboxed numeric constants
    on x86oids are arranged in memory differently, and the disassembler
    does not show them separately in DISASSEMBLE, but does
    if DISASSEMBLE-CODE-COMPONENT is used. (lp#1421987)
  * optimization: The compiler's treatment of type specifiers makes
    it slightly faster and more memory-efficient. Portable code
    should be indifferent to this change, however, users of
    SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-TYPE might notice that (MEMBER T NIL)
    and (MEMBER NIL T) are both internally collapsed to the former,
    so that the latter can never be obtained as part of an FTYPE.
  * optimization: a TYPEP call in which the second argument is not a
    QUOTE form but nevertheless recognized as a compile-time constant
    might open-code the test. One scenario for this involves backquote,
    such as (TYPEP x `(my-type ,some-arg)). Code which relied upon
    deferring until runtime should declare (NOTINLINE TYPEP).
    [Due to the sematic constraints of DEFTYPE etc in in CLHS 3.2.2.3,
    code requiring delayed evaluation could be unportable though.]
  * enhancement: unused variables at the top-level are now reported.
    (lp#492200)
  * bug fix: DEFCLASS handles cyclic {super,meta}class relations better
    (lp#1418883)
  * bug fix: compiler no longer signals an error when compiling certain
    function calls. (lp#1416704, lp#404441, lp#1417822, lp#1234919)
  * bug fix: compiler doesn't stumble on a LOGIOR transform. (lp#1389433)
  * bug fix: more robust debugger and backtraces. (lp#1413850, lp#1099500,
    lp#1412881, lp#945261, lp#1419205, lp#1409402)
  * bug fix: files larger than 4GB can now be compiled.
  * bug fix: x86 truncated results from 64-bit foreign functions to 32 bits.
  * bug fix: file-position didn't work on large files on win32. (lp#1271545)
  * bug fix: callbacks from foreign threads can work without enabling
    sb-safepoint.
  * bug fix: sb-introspect:function-lambda-list works properly on interpeted
    macros. (lp#1387404)
  * bug fix: ADJUST-ARRAY properly handles non-adjustable arrays. (lp#886418)
  * bug fix: compiler no longer fails to dump a multidimensional array
    constant involving a circular reference to itself
  * bug fix: conditional and nested DX allocation no longer confuse the
    compiler in STACK analysis. (lp#1044465)
  * bug fix: sb-rotate-byte constant folding bug fixed. (lp#1423682)

changes in sbcl-1.2.8 relative to sbcl-1.2.7:
  * enhancement: better error and warning messages. (lp#1314767, lp#736383)
  * enhancement: backtrace for invalid argument count produces the exact
    supplied arguments including the extra ones, on x86, x86-64 and ARM.
  * enhancement: a STYLE-WARNING is signaled for DEFSTRUCT accessors which
    are used before the structure is defined; similarly for the predicate.
  * optimization: FORMAT NIL with only ~a and string arguments is transformed
    into CONCATENATE.
  * optimization: POSITION and FIND when inlined into code that is compiled
    with qualities of safety < 2 and speed > space will no longer signal
    an error on circular lists, but will potentially loop forever if given
    no :END constraint. As was always the case, calls that are not inlined
    are safe regardless of lexical policy.
  * bug fix: CLOS methods compiled with (OPTIMIZE (DEBUG 0))
    no longer cause debugger failure when printing a backtrace
  * bug fix: more resilience to deleted code. (lp#1308328, lp#1390544)
  * bug fix: the CLHS example of MAKE-LOAD-FORM involving TREE-WITH-PARENT
    did not work, and now it does.

changes in sbcl-1.2.7 relative to sbcl-1.2.6:
  * optimization: returning constant values refers to preboxed constants
    more reliably. (lp#1398785)
  * enhancement: a STYLE-WARNING is produced if a compiler-macro is defined
    for a function after at least one ordinary (not inlined) call to that
    function was compiled, indicating a likely compilation order problem.
    Likewise a warning ensues if a call is compiled to a function
    that is subsequently proclaimed INLINE.
  * enhancement: always lose() when something goes wrong while saving a core
    (instead of just printing an error on stderr in some situations).
  * enhancement: frames in the debugger are now restartable by default.
  * bug fix: restore error handling on Windows x86.
  * bug fix: MAKE-SEQUENCE detects type errors in its :INITIAL-ELEMENT
    at compile-time when possible. (lp#330299)
  * bug fix: parsing of malformed type specifiers no longer results
    in a memory-fault-error.
  * bug fix: LOOP properly destructures nested lists in WITH.
  * bug fix: MACROEXPANDing the redefinition of an alien structure type no
    longer signals the wrong error.
  * bug fix: PROGV doesn't get confused by forced DEBUG 3 (lp#1405456).

changes in sbcl-1.2.6 relative to sbcl-1.2.5:
  * enhancement: SERVE-EVENTS uses the poll() system call in lieu of
    select() if the OS has the former. Previously poll() was used
    only if waiting on exactly one file descriptor.
  * enhancement: efficiency of access to untagged structure slots is improved
    on x86-64, and the order of slots in memory is exactly as specified by
    defstruct, simplifying use of structures as arguments to foreign calls.
  * bug fix: SB-DEBUG:ARG now works in all TRACE options which evaluate forms.
   (lp#1357826)
  * bug fix: GC memory corruption during internal memory handling.
  * bug fix: duplicate effective-slot-definition objects as compared
    by EQ on name could be present in CLASS-SLOTS of a class whose
    metaclass was structure-class or condition-class. (lp#1049423)
  * bug fix: HANDLER-BIND with empty bindings works again; regression in
    1.2.5. (lp#1388707)
  * bug fix: ATOMIC-INCF works on structure slots in interpreted code.
    (lp#1381867)
  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY properly handles character types like (eql #\a) and
    (member #\a #\c). (lp#1392068)
  * bug fix: READ sometimes accidentally preserved a whitespace character
    after a token when it should not have. (lp#327790)

changes in sbcl-1.2.5 relative to sbcl-1.2.4:
  * enhancement: sb-bsd-sockets now has basic support for IPv6
  * enhancement: An sb-unicode package has been added, containing
    many functions related to handling Unicode text
  * enhancement: The reader now normalizes symbols to Normalization
    Form KC (NFKC). This behavior can be disabled with
    SB-EXT:READTABLE-NORMALIZATION
  * enhancement: a style-warning is signaled if OPTIMIZE declarations
    multiply specify a quality with differing values. (lp#310267)
  * bug fix: conservatively pointed to pages wipe out unused dwords so
    that they cannot act as false roots in turn.
  * bug fix: the walker's handling of lexical variable and symbol-macro
    bindings is improved (lp#375326, lp#1368305)
  * bug fix: HANDLER-{BIND,CASE} no longer drop into ldb when a clause
    contains an undefined condition type; regression in 1.1.19 (lp#1378939)
  * bug fix: in interpreted code, inequality predicates did not type-check
    arguments that weren't examined, and a 1-argument use of MIN or MAX
    accepted a complex number. (lp#1373702)
  * bug fix: APROPOS and APROPOS-LIST handle inherited symbols correctly.
    (lp#1364413, thanks to Zach Beane)

changes in sbcl-1.2.4 relative to sbcl-1.2.3:
  * enhancement: the sequence functions MAP, CONCATENATE and MERGE now call
    the new generic functions SEQUENCE:MAP, SEQUENCE:CONCATENATE and
    SEQUENCE:MERGE respectively when the specified result type designates an
    extended sequence.
  * bug fix: Wrong binding order of supplied-p parameters in macro lambda
    lists.  (lp#721135)
  * bug fix: VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS returns T when the superclass is the
    universal superclass (lp#1332983)
  * bug fix: reading an uninterned symbol whose print name has the
    syntax of an integer signals an error. (lp#310062)
  * bug fix: the walker is less likely to be confused when walking LET* forms
    with special bindings and use of those bindings and others of the same
    name.
  * bug fix: a rare bug affecting 32-bit platforms resulting in a
    fatal condition with the message "Globaldb rehash failure" has been fixed.

changes in sbcl-1.2.3 relative to sbcl-1.2.2:

    additional to global functions.
  * enhancement: ASDF updated to 3.1.3
  * enhancement: UIOP can be loaded without ASDF.
  * bug fix: some methods on CHANGE-CLASS did not finalize the new class
    before accessing its class-precedence list.
  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS no longer fails on unbound slots in the source
    object.
  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS signals an appropriate error when the destination
    class is a FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASS.
  * bug fix: CHANGE-CLASS no longer signals bogus TYPE-ERRORs for slots for
    which initargs have been supplied.
  * bug fix: saving cores on ARM was broken since the introduction of GENCGC.
    (lp#1349795)
  * bug fix: macroexpanding a backquoted expression involving ",."
    outside of the compiler failed. (lp#1354623)

changes in sbcl-1.2.2 relative to sbcl-1.2.1:
  * incompatible change: the #\` ("backquote") reader macro was reimplemented
    to support robust pretty-printing. Reading a form involving #\` produces
    an invocation of the QUASIQUOTE ordinary macro which may contain subforms
    that are not lists. Code that unportably attempts operations on
    un-evaluated forms resulting therefrom, e.g.
      (SUBST a b (read-from-string "`(x (,y))"))
    might generate incorrect results and/or errors.
  * enhancement: support for GNU/kFreeBSD x86.
  * enhancement: ATOMIC-INCF and ATOMIC-DECF can operate on (CAR x), (CDR x)
    and DEFGLOBAL variables of type fixnum.
  * enhancement: arithmetic constant reduction is now performed on defconstant
    constants too. (lp#1337069).
  * bug fix: certain ftype proclamations containing &optional t &rest t no
    longer cause subsequent definitions to signal bogus style-warnings.
  * bug fix: #\Bell and #\Bel now read to different characters. (lp#1319452).
  * bug fix: CAS SYMBOL-VALUE on locally special variables didn't work.
    (lp#1098355)

    to Robert Swindells)
  * enhancement: support for DragonFly BSD.  (lp#1292845, thanks to Vasily
    Postnicov)
  * bug fix: TYPE-OF must not return AND/OR/NOT expressions.
    (lp#1317308)
  * bug fix: accessing NIL arrays stopped producing errors. (lp#1311421)
  * bug fix: DISASSEMBLE no longer prints unwanted stuff. (lp#1251861)
  * bug fix: compiling SVREF on unknown types no longer produces scary errors.
    (lp#1258716)
  * bug fix: assorted LOOP fixes and enhancements. (lp#645534, lp#1322923,
    lp#700538, lp#613876, lp#695286, lp#798388)
  * bug fix: silence compiler notes from the SEARCH transform. (lp#1071310)
  * bug fix: array type intersection handles T and unknown element types
    correctly. (lp#1258716)
  * bug fix: fix a corner case in array type unparsing that would result in
    misleading translations from our internal type representation.
  * bug fix: array-rank now sees through union and intersection types.
    (lp#1310574)
  * bug fix: when DECLARE expressions are in the wrong place, be careful not
    to attempt to evaluate the subforms.  (lp#573747; thanks to Roman
    Marynchak)
  * bug fix: misplaced and missing declarations in DEFTRANSFORM. (lp#1066451)
  * bug fix: FBOUNDP returned NIL for a class of incorrect function names
    instead of signaling an error. (lp#1095483)
  * bug fix: fix a compile-time AVER in regalloc: lifetime analysis
    used to (rarely) introduce duplicate conflict markers in a single
    TN/block pair. (lp#1327008)

changes in sbcl-1.2.0 relative to sbcl-1.1.18:

    by AMOP.  (lp#861004)

changes in sbcl-1.1.18 relative to sbcl-1.1.17:
  * optimization: COERCE is now more effecient for more cases when the type is
    known at compile-time.
    (lp#1309815)
  * bug fix: correctly inherit condition initforms. (lp#1300904)
  * bug fix: properly pprint literal functions inside nested lists.
    (lp#1300716)
  * bug fix: more-correctly handle array-type unity (broken for ages, causing
    compilation problems since 1.1.13.x due to smarter TYPEP type propagation,
    reported by jasom in #lisp).

changes in sbcl-1.1.16 relative to sbcl-1.1.15:
  * minor incompatible change: improve read/print consistency for pathnames on
    Win32, by using the circumflex character #\^ as the escape character.
    (lp#673625)
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:DEFINE-LOAD-TIME-GLOBAL. (lp#1253688)
  * enhancement: Loading fasls with symbols from an undefined package includes
    the name of the symbol in the error message.
  * bug fix: problems when redefining classes and doing TYPEP on classes
    concurrently. (lp#1272742)
  * bug fixes to the x86-64 XCHG instruction:
    ** it was misencoded when used with RAX, R8-R15 registers. (reported by
       Eric Marsden)
    ** it was misencoded when used to exchange EAX with itself.
    ** the disassembler wrongly printed XCHG RAX, R8 and the corresponding
       32- and 16-bit variations as NOP.
  * bug fix: the disassembler outputs source annotations in the right place
    and no longer randomly drops some of them. (lp#1249205)
  * bug fix: fix commutative-arg-swap from introducing undumpable structures
    into code, prevent code with errors from being compiled. (lp#1276282)

  * bug fix: the deterministic profiler now uses ENCAPSULATE functionality to
    wrap functions around. (lp#309086)

changes in sbcl-1.1.15 relative to sbcl-1.1.14:
  * new feature: the iterative spilling/coloring register allocator developed
    by Alexandra Barchunova during Google Summer of Code 2013 is now merged
    in.  By default, it only activates for functions that optimize with
    (speed 3) and (> speed compilation-speed), but setting
    sb-regalloc:*register-allocation-method* to :iterative forces its
    execution.  The previous behaviour can be obtained by instead setting that
    variable to :greedy.  Thanks again to Google for their support, and, more
    crucially, to Alexandra Barchunova for her hard work.
  * optimization: make-array with known element-type and unknown dimensions is
    much faster.
  * optimization: make-array with unknown element-type is faster as well.
    (lp#1004501)
  * enhancement: sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die on Windows now accepts
    :application-type argument, which can be :console or :gui. :gui allows
    having GUI applications without an automatically appearing console window.
  * enhancement: reduced conservativism on GENCGC platforms:
    conservative roots must be valid-looking tagged pointers or point
    within a code object, not merely point to within the allocated part
    of a page, in order to pin a page.
  * enhancement: support for "Mac Roman" external format.
  * enhancement: encapsulation of named generic functions now happens without
    altering the identity of the function bound to the name.
  * bug fix: Windows applications without the console window no longer misbehave.
    (patch by Wilfredo Velazquez, lp#1256034).
  * bug fix: modular arithmetic optimizations do not stumble on dead branches
    with bad constants. (reported by Douglas Katzman)
  * bug fix: CLISP can be used again as a cross-compilation host.
    (Thanks to Vasily Postnicov, lp#1261451)
  * bug fix: run-program crashed with :directory nil. (lp#1265077)

changes in sbcl-1.1.14 relative to sbcl-1.1.13:

  * optimization: EQUALP on structures with raw slots (double-float/complex)
    no longer conses and is faster.
  * optimization: RESTART-CASE expands to more compact code.
    Thanks to Jan Moringen. (lp#1249055)

  * enhancement: better ARRAY-RANK result derivation. (lp#1252108)
  * bug fix: EQUALP now compares correctly structures with raw slots larger
    than a single word.
  * bug fix: contribs couldn't be built on Windows with MinGW.
  * bug fix: Better pathname handling on Windows. (lp#922117)
  * bug fix: OPEN reports a more meaningful error when an existing file is
    opened for output with :if-exists :new-version.  Thanks to Philip
    Munksgaard. (lp#455381)
  * bug fix: DEFSTRUCTs with NIL as a slot name no longer cause strange
    CLOS-related errors.  (lp#633911)

  * other improvements to SXHASH:
    ** use the whole of the positive-fixnum range for SXHASH of fixnums
  * enhancement: The error message when calling an undefined alien function
    includes the name of the function on x86-64.
  * enhancement: sb-ext:run-program now supports :environment on Windows.
  * enhancement: ASDF is no longer required to load contribs at runtime.
    (lp#1132254)

    COMPUTE-RESTARTS, making it faster and cons less (lp#769615)
  * enhancement: FIND-RESTART and COMPUTE-RESTARTS handle huge restart
    clusters better in some cases
  * enhancement: SOME/ANY/other quantification higher-order functions no
    longer cons. (lp#1070635)

    [type] except for the number of values.  (Reported by Nathan Trapuzzano
    on sbcl-help)
  * bug fix: signal errors in required cases of slot-definition initialization
    protocol.  (lp#309072)
  * bug fix: run-sbcl.sh works better in the presence of symlinks on OS X.
    (thanks to Stelian Ionescu, lp#1242643)
  * bug fix: when given a restart object, FIND-RESTART checks whether the
    restart is active and, when a condition is supplied, whether the restart
    is associated to a different condition (lp#774410)

changes in sbcl-1.1.12 relative to sbcl-1.1.11:

    rather than a failed AVER.  (reported by Paul Nathan)
  * bug fix: Parsing of &optional/&key/&rest arguments now never overwrites
    arguments during copying on x86 and x86-64; it may still happen on other
    platforms when there are more fixed arguments than stack slots.
    (reported by Jan Moringen)

changes in sbcl-1.1.11 relative to sbcl-1.1.10:
  * enhancement: support building the manual under texinfo version 5.
    (lp#1189146)

    NetBSD.  (thanks to Robert Swindells)
  * bug fix: undefined function errors are now properly reported on PPC and MIPS.

    either NIL or :ERROR.  (reported by Jan Moringen)

changes in sbcl-1.1.10 relative to sbcl-1.1.9:
  * enhancement: ASDF has been updated to 3.0.2.
  * optimization: stack frames are packed more efficiently on x86oids, which
    ought to reduce the frequency of Methuselahn conservative references (it
    certainly helps with gc.impure.lisp / BUG-936304 on x86).
  * optimization: on x86 and x86-64, integer negation forms like (- x) are now
    recognized in modular arithmetic contexts, and compile to native negate,
    rather than going through bignums only to keep the low bits.
  * bug fix: Compiling potential modularic arithmetic forms does not cause type
    errors when some integer types lack lower or upper bounds. (lp#1199127)

    prefixes as used on x86 and x86-64 no longer sometimes print incorrectly.
    (lp#1085729)
  * bug fix: Specialised SIMD-PACK types can be negated.
  * bug fix: Modular arithmetic is more robust. (incidentally fixes another bug
    reported by Eric Marsden)
  * bug fix: FP return values from foreign calls are always rounded to single
    or double float precision on x87.
  * bug fix: Known-safe vector access on x86oids should not fail spuriously
    when the index is of the form (+ x constant-positive-integer).
  * bug fix: Remove GPL-licensed files from source distribution. (lp#1185668)
  * bug fix: backtrace printer no longer tries to create very large lists when
    the arg-count register is clobberred by other code. (lp#1192929)
  * bug fix: x86 should never signal an FP exception while boxing an FP value,
    a situation that lands us into ldb.

changes in sbcl-1.1.8 relative to sbcl-1.1.7:
  * notice: The implementation of MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS (the heart of
    ROOM, plus a few SB-INTROSPECT functions) has been completely
    rewritten; it may now exhibit different bugs than before.
  * new feature: minimal runtime/compiler intrastructure support for SSE
    SIMD values, as SB-EXT:SIMD-PACK. Enabled on x86-64 via the build-time
    feature :sb-simd-pack. This should enable intrinsics extensions as
    libraries, without patching SBCL itself. Thanks to Alexander Gavrilov
    for maintaining a branch for so long.
  * enhancement: RUN-PROGRAM supports a :DIRECTORY argument to set
    the working directory of the spawned process.
    (lp#791800) (patch by Matthias Benkard)
  * enhancement: boxed vectors (vectors of T or of FIXNUM) can now be
    stack-allocated on PPC.
  * enhancement: "fixed objects" can now be stack-allocated on PPC.
  * enhancement: WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS no longer conses on PPC/GENCGC.
  * enhancement: (sb-introspect:find-definition-sources-by-name x :vop) now
    also returns VOPs which do not translate any functions, and finds
    defoptimizer types ir2convert and stack-allocate-result.
  * enhancement: better type derivation for APPEND, NCONC, LIST.
    (lp#538957)
  * enhancement: MAP-ALLOCATED-OBJECTS (the heart of ROOM) now walks the
    heap in a manner similar to the GC rather than its previous ad-hoc
    scheme, and is therefore no less and possibly more accurate.
  * fixes and enhancements related to Unicode:
    ** the character database information has been updated to Unicode 6.2;
    ** support for canonical and compatibility decomposition of characters has
       been added, along with support for primary composition;
    ** support for Unicode normalization forms of strings (NFC, NFKC, NFD and
       NFKD) has been included;

    that provide an "invalid" stack frame link for the signal handler
    itself now use the saved-fp-and-pc mechanism to pick up from the stack
    frame in the interrupt (signal) context.  This is known to affect
    threaded FreeBSD/x86-64.
  * bug fix: some LOOP statements couldn't be compiled.
    (lp#1178989)
  * bug fix: sb-sequence:dosequence works on literal vectors.
  * bug fix: errors in generic arithmetic show the assembly routine's
    caller on x86 and x86-64. (lp#800343)
  * bug fix: Compile-time type errors should never result in COMPILE-FILE
    failure. (lp#943953)
  * bug fix: Known bad local calls do not cause strange failures when
    emitting or dumping code. (lp#504121)
  * bug fix: Multiply-inlined structure constructor don't cause IR2-time
    codegen errors: type checks are inserted as necessary. (lp#1177703)
  * bug fix: Unsigned modular arithmetic is correctly converted into signed
    modular arithemtic (mostly to exploit fixnum-width VOPs). (lp#1026634)
  * bug fix: a combination of inlined local function with &optional and
    recursion no longer causes undescriptive compiler errors. (lp#1180992)
  * bug fix: sub-word BOOLEAN alien types now disregard higher order bits
    when testing for non-zero-ness.
  * bug fix: (CONCATENATE 'null ...) no longer fails for generic sequences.
    (lp#1162301)
  * bug fix: Type mismatch for the value of conditional expressions are
    correctly reported when detected at compile-time, instead of complaining
    about a constant NIL (similar for non-EQ-comparable catch tags).
  * bug fix: Referring to INLINE global functions as values should not result
    in a compilation failure. (lp#1035721)
  * optimization: faster ISQRT on fixnums and small bignums
  * optimization: faster and smaller INTEGER-LENGTH on fixnums on x86-64.
  * optimization: On x86-64, the number of multi-byte NOP instructions used
    for code alignment is now always minimal.
  * optimization: On 64-bit targets, the compiler generates much faster
    code for type checks for types known at compile time that are smaller
    than (SIGNED-BYTE 64) or (UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) and larger than FIXNUM, and
    their COMPLEX variants.
  * optimization: On x86 targets, more uses of ALIEN-FUNCALL during cross
    compilation now inline the INVOKE-WITH-SAVED-FP-AND-PC dance.
  * optimization: ROOM no longer conses so egregiously on non-x86oid
    systems.
  * optimization: associative bitwise operations reassociate patterns like
    (f (f x k1) k2) to expose (f x (f k1 k2)).  Same for + and * of
    rational values.
  * optimization: quasiquote expressions now perform more constant folding,
    instead of consing equal lists at runtime. (lp#1026439)
  * optimization: local call analysis of inlined higher-order function
    should converge more quickly, resulting in better code for complex
    functions.
  * optimization: On x86-64, medium (word-sized but wider than 32 bits)
    integer constants are handled more cleverly, especially when they
    can be represented as sign-extended (signed-byte 32). (Based on a
    patch by Douglas Katzman)
  * optimization: IF/IF conversion should reliably result in sane code
    when (some of) the results of the inner IF are always false or
    always true.
  * optimization: On x86oids, variable right shifts of machine words are
    compiled into straight SAR/SHR, instead of going through the generic
    VOP. (lp#1066204)

changes in sbcl-1.1.7 relative to sbcl-1.1.6:
  * enhancement: TRACE :PRINT-ALL handles multiple-valued forms.
    (lp#457053)
  * bug fix: :allocation slot option works for condition slots
    (lp#1049404)
  * bug fix: redefining conditions does not lead to multiple evaluations of
    hairy slot initfunctions anymore (lp#1164969)
  * bug fix: CLASS-DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS now works for condition classes
    (lp#1164970)
  * bug fix: function constants now work as initforms and default initarg
    values of conditions (lp#539517)
  * bug fix: svref/(setf svref) on symbol macros don't crash the compiler
    anymore. (Minimal test case provided by James M. Lawrence on sbcl-devel)
  * bug fix: no more bogus ## references when pretty printing backquoted
    forms with non-trivial structure sharing. (lp#1161218)
  * bug fix: Don't signal an error on (setf (documentation nil 'function)
    "doc").  Signal a style-warning instead when trying to set documentation
    of NIL for all other documentation types.  (Reported by Zach
    Beane; regression since 2e52fa05.)
  * bug fix: modular arithmetic involving large constants and conditionals
    should no longer result in spurious dead code elimination.  (Reported by
    Eric Marsden).
  * bug fix: our mach exception handler can seemingly called very early in
    the program execution process on OS X 10.8.0. Try and handle that case
    robustly, without potentially leaking mach ports too much.
  * optimization: LOGBITP and LOGTEST optimizations from x86 ported to x86_64.

changes in sbcl-1.1.6 relative to sbcl-1.1.5:
  * enhancement: the continuable error when defknown-ing over extant
    fndb entries can be ignored by passing :overwrite-fndb-silently t
    as a keyword argument to sb-c:defknown (after attributes). Useful
    to allow defknown to be re-loaded. Use with :allow-other-keys t
    for backward compatibility.
  * optimization: compiler is much faster in compiling SVREF and (SETF SVREF)
    forms.
  * bug fix: Prevent a make-array transform from modifying source forms
    causing problems for inlined code. Thanks to Bart Botta.
    (regression since 1.0.42.11-bis)
  * bug fix: clear-output calls the correct gray stream routine,
    sb-gray:stream-clear-output. (lp#1153257)
  * bug fix: an error is signalled for an invalid format modifier: ~<~@>.
    (lp#1153148)
  * bug fix: Better error messages for package operations (lp#1154776)
  * bug fix: delete-package on a nonexistent package should signal a cerror.
    (regression since 1.0.37.44).
  * bug fix: accessing &MORE (stack allocated &REST) arguments checks bounds.
    (lp#1154946, lp#1072112)
  * bug fix: compiling make-array no longer signals an error when the
    element-type is an uknown type, a warning is issued instead.
    Thanks to James Kalenius (lp#1156095)
  * bug fix: SEARCH on generic (non-VECTOR non-LIST) sequence types no longer
    produces wrong results for some inputs.  (Thanks to Jan Moringen.)
    (lp#1153312)

changes in sbcl-1.1.5 relative to sbcl-1.1.4:
  * minor incompatible change: SB-SPROF:WITH-PROFILING no longer loops
    by default.
  * new feature: package local nicknames. See manual for details.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:MAP-DIRECTORY provides a powerful interface for
    directory traversal: it is the backend used by SBCL for CL:DIRECTORY.
  * enhancement: easier to use restarts for resolving name-conflicts
    resulting from IMPORT, EXPORT, or USE-PACKAGE.
  * enhancement: variant DEFPACKAGE forms now signal a full error with
    restarts provided for resolving the situation. (lp#891351)
  * enhancement: by setting SB-EXT:*ON-PACKAGE-VARIANCE* appropriately variant
    DEFPACKAGE forms can now signal a full error with restarts provided for
    resolving the situation. See manual for details. (lp#891351)
  * enhancement: make-random-state now uses CryptGenRandom as a seed on Windows.
    (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.) (lp#1102748)
  * enhancement: backtrace improvements
    ** secondary CLOS dispatch functions have better debug names (lp#503081)
    ** easier to read method names in backtraces. See
       SB-DEBUG:*METHOD-FRAME-STYLE*.
    ** SB-DEBUG:PRINT-BACKTRACE and SB-DEBUG:LIST-BACKTRACE are available as
       forwards-compatible replacements for SB-DEBUG:BACKTRACE and
       SB-DEBUG:BACKTRACE-AS-LIST.
    ** SB-DEBUG:*SHOW-ENTRY-POINT-DETAILS** has been deprecated, as the same
       information is available in less intrusive form as frame annotations.
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now provides MAP-ANON.
  * enhancement: test-suite results are colorized, failures in red, unexpected
    success in green. Works on Windows and on terminals with ANSI escape code
    support. Can be disabled with --no-color.
  * optimization: SB-CONCURRENCY:QUEUE implementation is more efficient.
    (thanks to James M. Lawrence)
  * bug fix: no more unused variable style warnings from RESTART-CASE
    macroexpansion (lp#1113859)
  * bug fix: no more unused variable style warnings when loading
    sb-bsd-sockets.asd (lp#1114681)
  * bug fix: deleting a package removes it from implementation-package
    lists of other packages.
  * bug fix: SB-SPROF:WITH-PROFILING is now usable in the Slime REPL on Darwin.
    This does not fix the occasional "interrupt already pending" issue, though.
  * bug fix: (setf (documentation 'x 'function)) and
    (setf (documentation #'x t)) set documentation in different places.
    (regression since 1.0.43.63)
  * bug fix: build on newer glibc. (lp#1095036)

changes in sbcl-1.1.4 relative to sbcl-1.1.3:
  * optimization: LOOP expressions using "of-type character" have slightly
    more efficient expansions.
  * bug fix: very long (or infinite) constant lists in DOLIST do not result
    in very long compile times or heap exhaustion anymore. (lp#1095488)
  * bug fix: `#3(1) is read as #(1 1 1), not as #(1). (lp#1095918)
  * bug fix: adjust-array ignored :initial-element for simple-vectors.
    (lp#1096359)
  * bug fix: optimizations to MAKE-INSTANCE with literal list initargs no
    longer cause infinite loops (on circular data) or violate eqlity
    constraints.  (lp#1099708)
  * bug fix: FIRST was not being open coded. (regression from 1.1.0)

changes in sbcl-1.1.3 relative to sbcl-1.1.2:
  * enhancement: warnings about bad locale settings, LANG, LC_CTYPE, etc.
    (lp#727625)
  * enhancement: support for C-c to interrupt the foreground thread
    on Windows.  (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: STDCALL alien callbacks. (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: Safepoint builds on POSIX platforms can now optionally be
    built without pseudo-atomic sequences and their run-time overhead.
  * enhancement: Threads created outside of Lisp can enter Lisp through
    alien callbacks and appear as Lisp threads for the duration of that
    function invocation.  On safepoint builds only.
  * enhancement: Miscellaneous improvements to namestrings and underlying
    calls to OS functions for file system access on Windows.  (Thanks to
    Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: The MSI installer support for Windows now uses Windows
    Installer XML at least version 3.5 and includes various usability
    improvements.  (Thanks to Dmitry Kalyanov and Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: The sb-bsd-sockets contrib now supports non-blocking-mode
    on Windows.  (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: The Windows backend now supports the x86-64 platform.
    (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
  * bug fix: fasls are now once again directly executable (on platforms
    supporting shebang lines, with a suitably-installed sbcl).
  * bug fix: make.sh --help no longer runs clean.sh. (lp#937001)
  * bug fix: Fix CAS access to slots of direct instances of structure classes
    in the presence of subclasses sharing the same conc-name.
  * bug fix: Logical pathname namestrings on Windows have been changed to
    be lower-case, to minimize differences between POSIX and Windows.

changes in sbcl-1.1.2 relative to sbcl-1.1.1:
  * notice: System requirements for SBCL on Microsoft Windows: Windows NT 5.1
    or newer (Windows XP, Server 2003) is required.  Support for Windows 2000
    (NT 5.0) is no longer being maintained.
  * notice: Starting with this version, SBCL on Windows no longer supports
    building with disabled thread support.
  * enhancement: frlocks have been added to SB-CONCURRENCY contrib module.
  * enhancement: New feature sb-dynamic-core allows the runtime to be
    rebuilt or relocated without requiring changes to the core file on
    all linkage table platforms.  Required on Windows.  (Thanks to Anton
    Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: Console I/O streams use UCS-2. (Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: I/O on Windows unnamed pipes is interruptible
    asynchronously using interrupt-thread, timers when running on Windows NT
    version 6.1 or newer (Windows 7, Server 2008 R2).  (Thanks to Anton
    Kovalenko.)
  * enhancement: Support for the experimental safepoint-based stop-the-world
    protocol on the PowerPC platform.
  * bug fix: Non-blocking reads from the Windows console were not necessarily
    non-blocking. Thanks to Anton Kovalenko. (lp#308923)
  * bug fix: stability of threads on Windows has been improved upon through
    an updated stop-the-world protocol (thanks to Anton Kovalenko).

changes in sbcl-1.1.1 relative to sbcl-1.1.0:
  * enhancement: WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT no longer grabs the world-lock.
    (COMPILE and COMPILE-FILE still do.)
  * optimization: the SPARC backend now supports the precise generational
    (GENCGC) garbage collection.  Enabled by default on Solaris/SPARC and
    Linux/SPARC.  Thanks to Raymond Toy (via CMUCL).
  * enhancement: add experimental support for the SB-THREAD feature and the
    timer facility on Windows.  Thanks to Dmitry Kalyanov and Anton Kovalenko.
    Threads are enabled by default, and this version of SBCL is considered
    to be the last and final release to officially support building with
    threads disabled.
  * optimization: The compiler no longer rotates loops in some cases where
    this transformation actually lead to worse code being generated.
  * bug fix: SB-CLTL2:MACROEXPAND-ALL correctly handles shadowing of
    symbol-macros by lexical bindings.
  * bug fix: stack allocation was prevented by high DEBUG declaration in
    several cases.
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:GC-LOGFILE signaled an error when no logfile was set.
    (thanks to SANO Masatoshi)
  * bug fix: PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING performed non-native parsing when
    :JUNK-ALLOWED was true.
  * bug fix: type derivation inferred overly conservative types for
    unions of array types. (lp#1050768)

changes in sbcl-1.1.0 relative to sbcl-1.0.58:
  * enhancement: New variable, sb-ext:*disassemble-annotate* for controlling
    source annotation of DISASSEMBLE output. Defaults to T.
  * enhancement: TIMEOUT arguments added to WITH-MUTEX and WITH-RECURSIVE-LOCK, and
    WAIT-P argument added to WITH-RECURSIVE-LOCK.
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:ATOMIC-PUSH and SB-EXT:ATOMIC-POP allow atomic operations
    on list heads.
  * enhancement: Optional features (not enabled by default) allow the
    use of signals for inter-thread synchronization to be reduced on certain
    supported platforms (currently Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD on x86 and
    x86-64).  Set (and :sb-thread :sb-safepoint :sb-thruption :sb-wtimer)
    to test these experimental features.  Known remaining bugs include minor
    thread safety issues, less timely freeing of memory by GC, and certain
    (not yet optimally low) runtime overhead.  Thanks to Anton Kovalenko.
  * optimization: CL:SORT and CL:STABLE-SORT of lists are faster and use fewer
    comparisons, particularly on almost-sorted inputs.
  * bug fix: Reading floats with large exponents no longer takes too much time
    before reporting that the exponent is too large.
  * bug fix: SB-BSD-SOCKETS:SOCKET-RECEIVE with a UDP socket now works
    correctly when the received datagram is larger than the provided buffer.
    (lp#1023438, thanks to Robert Uhl)
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:GET-CAS-EXPANSION returned a bogus read-form when given
    a SYMBOL-VALUE form with a constant symbol argument.
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:GET-CAS-EXPANSION signaled an error when a macro expanding
    into a DEFCAS defined place was used as the place.
  * bug fix: FIND and POSITION signaled a type-error when non-bits where looked
    for from bit-vectors.
  * bug fix: a race condition around thread creation could (in SBCL 1.0.57)
    lead to internal errors or crashes (lp#1058799).
  * documentation: a section on random number generation has been added to the
    manual. (lp#656839)

changes in sbcl-1.0.58 relative to sbcl-1.0.57:
  * enhancement: implicit generic function warnings now specify the package
    in which the new generic function is being created.
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:ATOMIC-UPDATE makes it easy to perform non-destructive
    updates of CAS-able places (similar to Clojure's swap!).
  * enhancement: run-program no longer decodes and re-encodes environment when
    :environment argument is not provided. (lp#985904)
  * enhancement: errors during compiler-macro expansion no longer cause
    runtime errors, only a compile-time warning, otherwise behaving as if
    the compiler macro had declined to expand.
  * optimization: On x86-64, code alignment of block headers is done with
    multi-byte NOPs now instead of repetitions of the single-byte NOP.
  * optimization: MAP-INTO is substantially faster when the target sequence is
    of unknown type; mapping into lists is no longer O(N^2). (lp#1001043,
    thanks to James M. Lawrence)
  * optimization: the compiler no longer heap-conses to check exits in cases
    where the exit function is dynamic extent, or when it can prove the exit
    function cannot escape. (lp#1002534)
  * optimization: SB-SEQUENCE:DOSEQUENCE is faster on vectors of unknown
    element type, and vectors that aren't SIMPLE-ARRAYs.
  * optimization: CL:SORT and CL:STABLE-SORT are more efficient in execution
    speed (around 1/3 the time in some cases), and a little better in terms of
    comparison calls. (Thanks to Takeru Ohta)
  * bug fix: On SPARC, a limitation on the number of code constants emittable
    by the compiler has been lifted, allowing certain long functions to
    compiled and assembled which had previously been unsupported; fixes
    cl-bench on this ISA (lp#1008996).
  * bug fix: potential for infinite recursion during compilation of CLOS slot
    typechecks when dependency graph had loops. (lp#1001799)
  * bug fix: error forms reported with some program-errors were not escaped
    properly.
  * bug fix: functions from EVAL are now on more equal footing with functions
    from COMPILE. (lp#1000783, lp#851170, lp#922408)
  * bug fix: ENSURE-GENERIC-METHOD-COMBINATION accepts method combination
    objects as its :METHOD-COMBINATION argument, not just lists designating
    method combinations. (lp#936513)
  * bug fix: run-program no longer unconditionally uses /tmp/ for temporary
    files. (lp#968837).
  * bug fix: restore build on solaris/sparc. (lp#1008506)

    this fixes an issue found with cl-postgres (thanks to Tomas Hlavaty).
  * bug fix: compiler-macro lambda-lists specifying non-keyword symbols
    as keyword arguments no longer accidentally match unevaluated symbols
    against them.
  * bug fix: FORMAT used to loop infinitely in some cases when a COLINC
    parameter was zero, now it signals an error. (lp#905817, fixed since
    1.0.56.19)
  * bug fix: run-program with :pty t no longer makes the pty as the process's
    controling terminal.
  * bug fix: spawning threads on OS X 10.8 no longer crashes the process
    (lp#1012811).

changes in sbcl-1.0.57 relative to sbcl-1.0.56:
  * RANDOM enhancements and bug fixes:
    ** bug fix: the range and distribution of random integers could be
       catastrophically wrong when the compiler derived the type of its
       argument as a disjoint set of small integers.
    ** bug fix: the distribution of random integers is now completely
       uniform even when the specified limit is not a power of two.
       (Previously some values could be about 0.1 % more probable than
       others in the worst case.) (lp#309467)
    ** RANDOM on large integer arguments is generally faster and conses
       less than before; this is visible for fixnums above a length of
       about 24 bits, but extremely so for bignums: the old implementation
       used time and space quadratical in the size of the argument there,
       the new one is linear.
  * enhancement: redesigned protocol for quitting SBCL. SB-EXT:EXIT is the new
    main entry point, SB-EXT:QUIT is deprecated.
  * enhancement: additions to the SB-THREAD API: RETURN-FROM-THREAD,
    ABORT-THREAD, MAIN-THREAD-P, and MAIN-THREAD.
  * enhancement: FASL loading no longer grabs the world-lock.
  * enhancement: GENCGC reclaims space more aggressively when objects being
    allocated are a large fraction of the total available heap space.
    (lp#936304)
  * enhancement: backtraces show the correct number of arguments for frames
    called with too many arguments.
  * enhancement: support for abort(3), exit(3), and _exit(2) has been added to
    SB-POSIX.
  * enhancement: ASDF has been updated 2.21.
  * optimization: fewer uses of full calls to signed modular functions.
    (lp#903821)
  * optimization: typechecking alien values is typically 5 x faster.
  * optimization: FDEFINITION, SYMBOL-FUNCTION, MACRO-FUNCTION, and FBOUNDP
    are 20% faster.
  * bug fix: file compilation performance issues when dumping subtypes
    of CHARACTER (lp#994487)
  * bug fix: fixed disassembly of some SSE instructions on x86-64.
  * bug fix: SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS signals an error for bogus :CLASS arguments in
    OPEN. (lp#969352, thanks to Kambiz Darabi)
  * bug fix: CASE normal-clauses do not allow T and OTHERWISE as keys.
    (lp#959687)
  * bug fix: (SETF (FIND-CLASS X) NIL) removed proper name of the underlying
    classoid even if X was not the proper name of the class. (lp#941102)
  * bug fix: declaration leakage between lexical environments due to careless
    use of NCONC in MAKE-LEXENV. (lp#924276)
  * bug fix: ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST now works when
    *default-pathname-defaults* contains NAME or TYPE components.
  * bug fix: PPRINT couldn't print improper lists with CARs being some symbols
    from CL package, e.g. (loop . 10).
  * bug fix: run-program with existent or non-existent files for :output or
    :input when :if-output-exists or :if-input-does-not-exist are NIL properly
    returns NIL instead of signalling an obscure error.
  * bug fix: fix miscompilation of some logand forms with large constant
    arguments.  (lp#974406)
  * bug fix: account for funcallable-instance objects properly in ROOM.
  * bug fix: incorrect octets reported for c-string decoding errors.
    (lp#985505)
  * bug fix: miscompilation of LDB on the PowerPC platform.  (thanks to Bruce
    O'Neel)
  * bug fix: better input error reporting for COMPILE-FILE. (lp#493380)
  * bug fix: default size of non-nursery generations has been shrunk on GENCGC,
    allowing faster release of memory back to the OS. (lp#991293)
  * bug fix: WITH-DEADLINE (:SECONDS NIL :OVERRIDE T) now drops any
    existing deadline for the dynamic scope of its body.
  * bug fix: compiler-internal interval arithmetic needed to be more
    conservative about open intervals when operated on by monotonic but not
    strictly-monotonic functions.  (lp#975528)
  * bug fix: copy-tree caused stack exhaustion on long linear lists, and now
    it's also slightly faster. (lp#998926)
  * bug fix: better error messages for malformed declarations.
    (lp#1000239)
  * bug fix: define-condition didn't return the name of the defined condition.
  * documentation:
    ** improved docstrings: REPLACE (lp#965592)

changes in sbcl-1.0.56 relative to sbcl-1.0.55:
  * bug fix: fix copy-structure.  When copying from stack to heap, garbage
    could end up in the heap making GC unhappy.
    (Thanks to James Knight, lp#911027)
  * enhancements
    ** SBCL can now be built using Clang.
    ** ASDF has been updated 2.20.
  * bug fix: compiler errors when weakening hairy integer types. (lp#913232)
  * bug fix: don't complain about a too-hairy lexical environment for inlining
    when the function has never been requested for inlining.  (lp#963530)

changes in sbcl-1.0.55 relative to sbcl-1.0.54:
  * enhancements to building SBCL using make.sh:
    ** --fancy can be specified to enable all supported feature enhancements.
    ** --with-<feature> and --without-<feature> can be used to specify
       which features to build with.
    ** --arch option can be used to specify the architecture to build for.
       (Mainly useful for building 32-bit SBCL's on x86-64 hosts, not
       full-blows cross-compilation.)
  * enhancement: extended package prefix syntax <pkgname>::<form-in-package>
    which allows specifying name of the default interning package for the
    whole form.
  * enhancement: when *READ-EVAL* is true, arrays with element type other than
    T can be printed readably using #.-based syntax. (Thanks to Robert Brown)
  * enhancement: MAKE-ALIEN signals a storage-condition instead of returning a
    null alien when malloc() fails. (lp#891268)
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:PRINT-UNREADABLY restart for PRINT-NOT-READABLE
    conditions can be conveniently accessed through function with the same
    name, analogously to CONTINUE.
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:*SUPPRESS-PRINT-ERRORS* can be used to suppress errors
    from the printer by type, causing an error marker to be printed instead.
    (Thanks to Attila Lendvai)
  * enhancement: BACKTRACE and DESCRIBE now bind *PRINT-CIRCLE* to T, and
    generally behave better when errors occur during printing.
  * enhancement: the test runner now takes a --report-skipped-tests argument
    to report the individual tests skipped as well as the number of skipped
    tests.
  * enhancement: undefined functions now appear in backtraces as ("undefined
    function") instead of ("bogus stack frame") on x86oids.
  * enhancement: detected deadlocks no longer cause stderr to be spammed, and
    deadlock errors are reported in an easier-to-decipher manner.
  * enhancement: DESCRIBE on type designators reports the expansion in more
    cases.
  * enhancement: SBCL now provides either an explicit :BIG-ENDIAN or
    :LITTLE-ENDIAN in *FEATURES*, instead of :BIG-ENDIAN being implied by lack
    of the :LITTLE-ENDIAN feature. (Thanks to Luís Oliveira, lp#901661)
  * enhancement: better disassembly of segment-prefixes on x86 and other
    instruction prefixes (e.g. LOCK) on x86 and x86-64.
  * optimization: FIND and POSITION on bit-vectors are orders of magnitude
    faster (assuming KEY and TEST are not used, or are sufficiently trivial.)
  * optimization: SUBSEQ on vectors of unknown element type is substantially
    faster. (lp#902537)
  * optimization: specialized arrays with non-zero :INITIAL-ELEMENT can
    be stack-allocated. (lp#902351)
  * optimization: the compiler is smarter about representation selection for
    floating point constants used in full calls.
  * optimization: the compiler no longer refuses to coerce large fixnums to
    single floats inline, except on x86 where this limitation is still
    necessary.
  * optimization: truncation operations on integers with constant divisor
    arguments 1 and -1 are optimized away.
  * bug fix: deadlock detection could report the same deadlock twice, for
    two different threads. Now a single deadlock is reported exactly once.
  * bug fix: interval-arithmetic division during type derivation did not
    account for signed zeros.
  * bug fix: compiler error when typechecking a call to a function with
    non-constant keyword arguments.
  * bug fix: misoptimization of TRUNCATE causing erratic behaviour.
  * bug fix: condition slot accessors no longer cause undefined function
    style-warnings when used in the :REPORT clause of the DEFINE-CONDITION
    form that defines them. (lp#896379)
  * bug fix: DEFGENERIC warns about unsupported declarations, as specified
    by ANSI. (lp#894202)
  * bug fix: SUBTYPEP tests involving forward-referenced classes no longer
    bogusly report NIL, T.
  * bug fix: bogus style-warnings for DEFMETHOD forms that both declared some
    required arguments ignored and performed assignments to others.
    (lp#898331)
  * bug fix: *EVALUATOR-MODE* :COMPILE treated (LET () ...) identically
    to (LOCALLY ...) leading to internally inconsistent toplevel-formness.
  * bug fix: non-toplevel DEFSTRUCT signaled a style warning for unknown type.
  * bug fix: redefining a function whose previous definition contained an
    unknown type no longer causes a style-warning. (lp#806243)
  * bug fix: undefined functions now appear in backtraces as ("undefined
    function") instead of ("bogus stack frame") on non-x86oids.
  * bug fix: backtraces are no longer cut off at ("undefined function") when
    called under certain circumstances (involving a caller-allocated stack
    frame) on PPC.
  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM leaked a file-descriptor per call on non-Windows
    systems. (regression since 1.0.53)

  * bug fix: broken standard streams no longer automatically cause recursive
    errors on debugger entry.
  * bug fix: build ignored --dynamic-space-size=<size> argument to make.sh
    (regression since 1.0.53)

    by package locks.
  * bug fix: Proper handling of --dynamic-space-size option on 32 bit platforms.

changes in sbcl-1.0.54 relative to sbcl-1.0.53:
  * minor incompatible changes:
    ** RENAME-FILE on a symbolic links used to rename the linked-to file
       instead of the link.
    ** DELETE-DIRECTORY on symbolic link to a directory used to delete the
       directory, but now signal an error instead. Use TRUENAME to resolve the
       pathname if you wish to delete the linked directory, and DELETE-FILE if
       you wish to delete the
    ** The internal SB-THREAD::SPINLOCK API has been deprecated, and using
       symbols associated with it will trigger a compile-time warning.
  * thread-related enhancements:
    (This work has been funded by the SBCL Threading 2011 IndieGoGo campaign.
     Many thanks to generous donors!)
    ** Threading is now more reliable on non-Linux platforms. We still don't
       consider threads on non-Linux platforms good enough to enable them by
       default, but they're in a clearly better shape now.
    ** Deadlines supported now on all platforms.
    ** All blocking functions in the threading API now have a :TIMEOUT
       argument.
    ** Semaphore notification objects have been added to SB-THREAD.
    ** SB-CONCURRENCY contrib now includes Allegro-style GATE objects.
    ** SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP has been extended to support SLOT-VALUE,
       STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS, and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS.
    ** Users can now defined new places usable with SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP
       using an API anologous to defining new SETFable places.
  * GC-related enhancements and bug fixes:
    ** --dynamic-space-size and --control-stack-size now understand Kb, Mb,
         and Gb suffixes. Default is megabytes as before.
    ** on GENCGC targets, the default dynamic space size is now 512Mb for
       32-bit systems, and 1Gb for 64-bit systems. (OpenBSD/x86-64 is the only
       exception, defaulting to mere 444Mb to fit under default ulimits.) The
       new defaults are in place to prevent hitting swap on low-end systems.
       Use build-time option --dynamic-space-size to build an SBCL with
       another default, or the runtime option to adjust the size at startup: a
       good size is at most equal to the amount of physical memory the system
       has.
    ** on GENCGC targets, nursery and generation sizes now default to 5% of
       dynamic-space size.
    ** on GENCGC targets, SB-KERNEL:MAKE-LISP-OBJ no longer categorically
       refuses to create SIMPLE-FUN objects.
    ** on 64-bit GENCGC targets, setting the nursery size above 4Gb now works.
       (lp#870868)
    ** on CHENEYGC targets, SB-KERNEL:MAKE-LISP-OBJ now does the same
       validation of pointer objects as GENCGC does, instead of a
       comparatively weak bounds-check against the heap spaces.
  * SB-BSD-SOCKETS bug fixes:
    ** GET-PROTOCOL-BY-NAME had a significant memory leak.
    ** GET-HOST-BY-NAME and GET-HOST-BY-ADDRESS small amounts of memory on
       systems with getaddrinfo().
    ** GET-HOST-BY-NAME and GET-HOST-BY-ADDRESS weren't thread or interrupt
       safe outside systems with getaddrinfo().
  * enhancement: ASDF has been updated 2.019.
  * enhancement: special-case TCO prevention for functions which never return
    extended to untrusted types, keeping one more frame's worth of debug
    information around in many cases.

    the system where on the filesystem the SBCL sources themselves are
    located.  (Thanks to Zach Beane)

    floating point numbers in some cases. (Thanks to Lutz Euler, lp#894498)
  * bug fix: on 64-bit targets, atomic-incf/aref does index computation
    correctly, even on wide-fixnum builds. (lp#887220)
  * bug fix: (DIRECTORY "foo/*/*.*") did not follow symlinks in foo/ that
    resolved to directories.
  * bug fix: type mismatch when assigning to lexical variables no longer
    result in fasl-dumping internal type objects. (lp#890750)
  * bug fix: type mismatch on (SETF AREF) and function return values no
    longer result in fasl-dumping internal type objects.
  * bug fix: With several combinations of argument types, for example (EXPT
    <integer> <(complex double)>), EXPT now uses double-precision throughout
    instead of partially calculating only to single-precision.  (lp#741564;
    thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * bug fix: SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD is no longer able to construct bogus
    objects when interrupted by GC on PPC.

changes in sbcl-1.0.53 relative to sbcl-1.0.52:
  * enhancement: on 64-bit targets, in src/compiler/generic/early-vm.lisp,
    the parameter n-fixnum-tag-bits may now vary from 1 (fixnum =
    (signed-byte 63)) to 3 (fixnum = (signed-byte 61)) at build-time.
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:WAIT-FOR allows waiting for arbitrary events.
  * minor(?) incompatible(?) change: The default fixnum width on 64-bit
    targets is now 63 bits (up from 61).
  * enhancement: DESCRIBE now reports a lambda-list and source location
    for complext setf-expanders.
  * bug fix: PUSH, PUSHNEW, POP, REMF, INCF, DECF, DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO,
    GETF, LOGBITP, LDB, and MASK-FIELD now arrange for non-primary values
    of multiple-valued places to be set to NIL, instead of signalling an
    error (per a careful reading of CLHS 5.1.2.3).
  * bug fix: floating-point traps now work on darwin/x86 and /x86-64.
  * bug fix: repair crash in x86oid darwin signal handling emulation
    when built with certain compilers.
  * bug fix: SB-ROTATE-BYTE misrotated to the right when using constant
    rotation arguments on x86-64. (lp#882151)
  * bug fix: low-level control flow optimisations could result in bogus
    code in functions with tail and non-tail calls to local functions on
    x86oids. (lp#883500)
  * bug fix: on SPARC/:sb-unicode, avoid crashing the assembler by trying
    to emit literal characters > (code-char 4095), for comparisons with
    constant characters.
  * bug fix: ROOM reported only the low 32 bits of dynamic space usage
    on 64 bit platforms. (lp#881445)
  * bug fix: DELETE-FILE did not MERGE-PATHNAMES, making it possible to
    delete the wrong file when using relative pathnames. (lp#882877)
  * bug fix: optimized SEARCH of vectors-on-vectors mishandled zero-length
    sequences and :KEY NIL.

  * enhancement: the --core command line option now accepts binaries with
    an embedded core.
  * enhancement: when built with :sb-core-compression, core files (regular
    or executable) can be compressed with zlib.  Use the :COMPRESSION
    argument to SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE to specify a compression level.
  * enhancement: --[no-]merge-core-pages determines whether the runtime
    hints the operating system that identical core pages between SBCL
    processes should share the same physical memory.  Default is to only
    enable this for compressed cores.
  * optimization: SLEEP no longer conses.
  * optimization: *PRINT-PRETTY* no longer slows down printing of strings
    or bit-vectors when using the standard pretty-print dispatch table.

    (lp#738464)
  * bug fix: compiler-errors causes by MEMBER types in conjunction with with
    AREF, CHAR, etc. (lp#826971)
  * bug fix: compiler-errors causes by integer arguments with composed of
    multiple ranges to ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P. (lp#826970)
  * bug fix: ,@ and ,. now signal a read-time error for certain non-list
    expressions. (lp#770184)
  * bug fix: complex single float literals are correctly aligned when used
    as arguments of arithmetic operators.
  * bug fix: on 32-bit platforms, rounding of double floats larger than a
    fixnum is correct.  (reported by Peter Keller)
  * bug fix: stray FD-HANDLERs are no longer left lying around after unwinds
    from RUN-PROGRAM.  (lp#840190, reported by Dominic Pearson; fix from Max
    Mikhanosha)
  * bug fix: redefining classes such that slots with custom allocation are
    added or removed works again.

changes in sbcl-1.0.51 relative to sbcl-1.0.50:
  * minor incompatible change: SB-BSD-SOCKET socket streams no longer
    participate in SERVE-EVENT by default: pass :SERVE-EVENTS T to
    MAKE-SOCKET-STREAM if using SERVE-EVENT.
  * enhancement: added support for socket keepalive timeout intervals
    and probe counts on Linux.
  * enhancement: building 32-bit SBCL on Linux/x86-64 now works without a
    chroot. (Use "SBCL_ARCH=x86 sh make.sh" to build.)
  * enhancement: added new toplevel options --quit and --non-interactive
    (lp#822712).
  * enhancement: the Windows port of SBCL now builds and runs on Wine
    (thanks to Anton Kovalenko).
  * enhancement: more, and more correct, SSE instruction definitions on
    x86-64 (thanks to Alexander Gavrilov).
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:SPIN-LOOP-HINT assembles to an instruction designed
    to help the processor execute spin loops, when applicable.  Currently
    implemented for x86 and x86-64.
  * optimization: unsigned integer divisions by a constant are implemented
    using multiplication (affects CEILING, FLOOR, TRUNCATE, MOD, and REM.)
  * optimization: improved type-derivation for LOAD-TIME-VALUE.
  * bug fix: correct RIP offset calculation in SSE comparison and shuffle
    instructions. (lp#814688)
  * bug fix: COERCE to unfinalized extended sequence classes now works.
    (reported by Jan Moringen; lp#815155)
  * bug fix: a compiler error during typecheck generation, reported by Eric
    Marsden. (lp#816564)

    or removed.
  * bug fix: fixed-format floating point printing with scaling factors.
    (lp#811386)
  * bug fix: using GCC >= 4.6 to build SBCL on x86 no longer breaks
    backtraces. (lp#818460)
  * bug fix: better backtraces for interrupted syscall frames on x86.
    (lp#549673)
  * bug fix: SSE comparison instructions can be disassembled even when one
    operand is in memory. (lp#814702)
  * bug fix: incomplete writes when not using SERVE-EVENTS. (lp#820599)

    type information associated with the VALUES form.
  * bug fix: broken warnings/errors for type-errors involving LOAD-TIME-VALUE
    forms. (lp#823014)
  * bug fix: OPEN :IF-EXISTS :APPEND now returns correct FILE-POSITION before
    first write (lp#561642).

    when (> SPEED SPACE).
  * optimization: local call trampolines (x86 and x86-64) are emitted
    inline.
  * optimization: implicit value cells for dynamic-extent closed-over bindings
    on x86 and x86-64 can hold unboxed values as well.

    functions. (lp#792363 and lp#394206)
  * bug fix: bound derivation for floating point operations is now more
    careful about rounding possibly closing open bounds. (lp#793771)
  * bug fix: SB-POSIX:SYSCALL-ERROR's argument is now optional. (accidental
    backwards incompatible change in 1.0.48.27)
  * bug fix: occasional debugger errors in when a type-error occured in a
    function with dynamic-extent &rest list.
  * bug fix: &optional and &key supplied-p arguments in DEFSTRUCT
    boa-construtors can be used to initialized structure slots.
  * bug fix: FMAKUNBOUND removes the MACRO-FUNCTION, should one exist.
    (lp#795705, regression)
  * bug fix: DIRECTORY works better on logical pathnames.
  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM no longer fails spuriously when argument strings
    are of the order of ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT. (lp#787237)
  * bug fix: the compiler no longer constant-folds NaNs in
    MAKE-{SINGLE,DOUBLE}-FLOAT. (lp#486812)
  * bug fix: FORMAT now handles floating point rounding correct, eg.

    interrupts for its body.
  * enhancement: source locations are now available for files loaded as
    source, compile-time-too evaluation, and initialization files.

  * enhancement: dynamic-extent for &rest lists stack allocate only their
    spines, not their argumets. While portable code should not rely on this,
    particularly in combination with inlining, it should make dynamic-extent
    easier to use safely.
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX improvements:
    ** WNOHANG and WUNTRACED are exported.
    ** SYSCALL-ERROR now also provides the name of the failing system call.
  * enhancement: --script improvements:
    ** errors on standard input, output, and error streams are handled and
       cause scripts to exit silently, making them easier to use in shell
       pipelines.
    ** backtraces from scripts now go to standard error instead of the
       terminal even if one is available.
    ** --script can be an argument, causing the script to be loaded from
       standard input.

    strings to foreign memory.
  * enhancement: (SETF GC-LOGFILE) allows logging garbage collections to

    allows the compiler to automatically elide rest-list allocation so long as
    the call sites are in functions that the compiler knows cannot escape.
    (lp#504575)
  * optimization: CALL-NEXT-METHOD using explicit arguments is faster,
    especially in safe code when none of the required arguments have changed
    their identities.
  * bug fix: blocking reads from FIFOs created by RUN-PROGRAM were
    uninterruptible, as well as blocking reads from socket streams created
    with for which :SERVE-EVENTS NIL. (regression from 1.0.42.43)

  * bug fix: better support for Solaris /bin/sh in sh-based tests.
  * bug fix: TRACE behaves better when attempting to trace undefined
    functions. (lp#740717)
  * bug fix: missed optimizations for (FUNCALL (LAMBDA ...) ...) in comparison
    to (FUNCALL #'(LAMBDA ...) ...).
  * bug fix: ((LAMBDA ...) ...) forms with invalid argument counts resulted in
    a compile-time error. (lp#720382)

    without complaints.
  * bug fix: less verbose source forms for functions from EVAL. (lp#747485)
  * bug fix: sense of SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS was inverted in a MAKE-INSTANCE
    optimization. (regression from 1.0.45.18/1.0.46.15)

    of DEFUN. (lp#675584)
  * bug fix: --dynamic-space-size argument is validated more carefully.
    (lp#721457)
  * bug fix: memory fault from printing a malformed simple-condition.
    (lp#705690)

    engages the obsolete instance protocol. (lp#766271)
  * bug fix: constant improper lists could break source coverage recording.
    (lp#767959)
  * bug fix: compiling calls to eg. MEMBER with massive constant list arguments
    could exhaust stack.

    and its compatriots.
  * optimization: core startup time is reduced by 30% on x86-64. (lp#557357)
  * bug fix: SB-DEBUG:BACKTRACE-AS-LIST guards against potentially leaking
    stack-allocated values out of their dynamic-extent. (lp#310175)
  * bug fix: attempts to use SB-SPROF for wallclock profiling on threaded
    x86-64 builds caused a type-error.
  * bug fix: calling COMPILE with something else than a lambda-expression as the
    second argument reports a more sensible error. (lp#718905)
  * bug fix: invalid combinations of :PREDICATE and :TYPE options in DEFSTRUCT
    are detected. (lp#520607)
  * bug fix: constant keyword argument checking didn't take :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS
    into account.
  * bug fix: SLOT-BOUNDP information is correct during MAKE-INSTANCE in the
    presence of (SETF SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS) and SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS
    methods. (regression from 1.0.45.18)
  * bug fix: INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :AROUND methods supplying initargs via
    CALL-NEXT-METHOD work correctly. (regression from 1.0.45.19)
  * bug fix: several foreign functions accepting string also accepted NIL and
    consequently caused a memory fault at 0 now signal a type-error instead.
    (lp#721087)
  * bug fix: under rare circumstances, constraint propagation could rewrite a
    variable reference to refer to a variable not in scope, causing an error
    during physical environment analysis when attempting to close over the
    variable. (lp#551227)
  * bug fix: SIMPLE-CONDITION :FORMAT-CONTROL defaults to NIL.

changes in sbcl-1.0.46 relative to sbcl-1.0.45:
  * enhancement: largefile support on Solaris.
  * enhancement: SB-PROFILE:REPORT now supports :LIMIT and :PRINT-NO-CALL-LIST
    arguments (lp#710017)

    distinguish unbound instance slots when using STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS
    &co. (lp#718039)
  * optimization: ERROR and CERROR are approximately 5 times faster.
  * optimization: optimized constructors are used for MAKE-INSTANCE of classes
    with applicable non-standard (SETF SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS),
    SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS, and INITIALIZE-INSTANCE :AROUND methods, speeding
    up instance creation in those cases.
  * optimization: arithmetic operations with multiple constant arguments in now
    have them reduced at compile-time. (lp#676414)

    were not handled correctly (lp#713063).
  * bug fix: printing waitqueue objects without setting *PRINT-CIRCLE* to T is now
    safe (lp#673630).
  * bug fix: Solaris/x86-64 wasn't getting built with lutex support by
    mistake. (lp#667297).
  * bug fix: CONSTANTLY generated functions had bogus lambda-lists. (lp#713626)
  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM :PTY option was racy on OpenBSD. (lp#669485)

    unintern the wrong symbol with the same name. (lp#693796)
  * bug fix: COPY-PPRINT-DISPATCH always has access to a pristine table,
    making it possible to restore the initial table if it has been messed up.

  * enhancement: ~/ and ~user/ are treated specially in pathnames.
    Refer to documentation for details.
  * enhancement: ASDF has been updated to version 2.010.
  * optimization: mutated closed-over variables that are only accessed by
    DYNAMIC-EXTENT closures (currently only FLET and LABELS functions
    declared to be DYNAMIC-EXTENT) are stored directly in their containing
    stack frame, rather than allocating a VALUE-CELL (lp#586103).
  * optimization: UNWIND-PROTECT cleanup functions are now declared
    DYNAMIC-EXTENT.
  * bug fix: backtracing function with &REST arguments now shows the full
    argument list. (lp#310173)
  * bug fix: return types for functions with complex lambda-lists are now
    derived properly (lp#384892)
  * bug fix: when SPEED > SPACE compiling CONCATENATE 'STRING with constant
    long string arguments slowed the compiler down to a crawl.
  * bug fix: closure VALUE-CELLs are no longer stack-allocated (lp#308934).
  * bug fix: non-standard MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA methods could break RETURN-FROM
    in the DEFMETHOD body.
  * bug fix: #<SB-C::DEFINED-FUN ...> should no longer appear in compiler
    messages, being instead replaced with the corresponding function name.

    operators. (lp#309448)

changes in sbcl-1.0.44 relative to sbcl-1.0.43:

  * enhancement: ALLOCATION-INFORMATION also provides the page the object
    resides on.
  * enhancement: default dynamic-space size can be configured at build-time
    without touching source, using the --dynamic-space-size argument to make.sh.

    as a place.
  * enhancement: ASDF has been updated to 2.009.
  * enhancement: the system detects known type-erros in calls better,
    signalling a full warning about violated proclaimed FTYPEs and violations
    of derived FTYPEs within the same file, including self-calls.
  * enhancement: new function: SB-EXT:DELETE-DIRECTORY is now provided.
  * optimization: constant-folding exploits numeric and character types, in
    addition member types.
  * optimization: numeric, character and member types that are inhabited by
    exactly one value are tested with EQL.
  * optimization: more conditional branches are eliminated during IR1.
    Branches are simplified before performing if/if-conversion, and simple
    equivalent branches (that only read the same constant or variable) are
    merged.
  * improvements to the Windows port:
    ** change: canonical unparsing form for pathname namestrings now uses / as
       directory separator. NATIVE-NAMESTRING still uses \ as the separator.

    so badly. (lp#654485)
  * bug fix: SB-INTROSPECT:FIND-DEFINITION-SOURCES-BY-NAME no longer signals
    an error for eg. STRUCTURE. (lp#458015)
  * bug fix: LOOP WITH NIL = ... signalled an unused variable style-warning.
    (lp#613871, thanks to Roman Marynchak)
  * bug fix: more reliable &REST list type derivation. (lp#655203)

    also declared NOTINLINE. (lp#655581)
  * bug fix: the compiler could attempt to emit constant left shifts of
    greater value than n-word-bits. (lp#309063)
  * bug fix: (SETF SYMBOL-FUNCTION) and (SETF FDEFINITION) clear derived
    type information for the function being set. (lp#659220)
  * bug fix: the system used to signal bogus STYLE-WARNINGs when functions
    containing self-calls were recompiled with a new signature, and failed
    to warn when a self-call using the old signature was left in. (lp#655126)
  * bug fix: incorrect FILE-POSITION on streams opened using :EXTERNAL-FORMAT
    :DEFAULT when the default external had character size other than 8 bits.
    (lp#657183)
  * bug fix: derived types of functions in the same file were implicitly
    trusted, leading to potential heap corruption when those function were
    defined incompatibly. (lp#657499)
  * bug fix: existing ASDF source registries are ignored when building
    contribs (lp#659105)
  * bug fix: short-form DEFSETF checks that the second argument is a symbol
    (lp#655824, thanks to Roman Marynchak)

    fork with multiple Lisp threads running is made on every platform,
    not just Darwin. (lp#451111)
  * bug fix: SB-BSD-SOCKETS and SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS could leave stale finalizers
    around when core was saved, which could cause undefined behaviour when the
    core was reified.
  * bug fix: Allow UNTRACE of functions that are no longer defined
    (lp#667657, thanks to Attila Lendvai)
  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY calls with invalid keyword argument lists now signal a
    compile-time warning (lp#664373, thanks to Stas Boukarev)

changes in sbcl-1.0.43 relative to sbcl-1.0.42:
  * incompatible change: FD-STREAMS no longer participate in the serve-event
    event-loop by default. (lp#316072)
    ** In addition to streams created by explicit calls to MAKE-FD-STREAM this
       affects streams from CL:OPEN.
    ** Streams from SOCKET-MAKE-STREAM still participate in serve-event by
       default, but this is liable to change: applications needing serve-event
       for socket streams should explicitly request it using :SERVE-EVENTS T
       in the call.

    breaking code that tried to write the value of a printer control variable.
    (lp#581564, thanks to Stas Boukarev)
  * bug fix: WRITE compiler macro did not handle output stream designators
    correctly. (lp#598374, thanks to Stas Boukarev)

    (not in launchpad, reported by sykopomp in #lispgames)
  * bug fix: package-locks failed to protect against compile-time effects of
    DEFUN when the symbol previously had a macro definition. (lp#576637)
  * bug fix: spurious ignore warnings even given (DECLARE IGNORE) in methods
    when parameter bindings mutated.  (reported by Faré Rideau; lp #611361)
  * bug fix: workaround for compiler hang in ORDER-UVL-SETS (lp#308914)

changes in sbcl-1.0.41 relative to sbcl-1.0.40:
  * optimization: validity of observed keyword initargs to MAKE-INSTANCE is
    cached, leading to many fewer expensive calls to
    COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS.
  * optimization: in the (unoptimized) general method for MAKE-INSTANCE on a
    CLASS argument, search for and call an appropriate optimized ctor function
    if it exists.
  * bug fix: WRITE always returns the correct value.

changes in sbcl-1.0.40 relative to sbcl-1.0.39:
  * bug fix: readdir now works on :inode64 darwin builds (lp#592897)
  * bug fix: Name conflicts between symbols passed as arguments to a single
    call to IMPORT no longer add multiple symbols with the same name to the

    (lp#533470).
  * bug fix: TRACE :ENCAPSULATE NIL now works on ppc/linux.

  * bug fix: Backtrace from undefined function on x86 and x86-64 now show
    the calling frame.
  * bug fix: linkage-table entries on PPC now no longer overflow their
    space allocation (potentially causing crashes if they are written out
    of order).
  * bug fix: Scrub control stack after scavenging in gencgc on non-x86oid
    platforms, preventing the GC from seeing stale pointers on the control
    stack in subsequent GCs (which would, and does, break invariants).
  * bug fix: 32-bit unicode external formats now work on big-endian systems.
  * bug fix: Literal characters with code points greater than about 32767
    now work on PPC UNICODE builds.
  * bug fix: Any noise left by SSE operations (sqrt and conversions) in the
    high order bits are explicitly cleared out. In some contrived situations,
    this could lead to wrong results in mixed real/complex float arithmetic.

  * incompatible change: Thread names are now restricted to SIMPLE-STRINGs
    like for any other thread-related datastructure, MUTEX, etc. (lp#547095)
  * deprecation: the SB-QUEUE contrib was merged into the SB-CONCURRENCY
    contrib module. New code should depend on SB-CONCURRENCY, not SB-QUEUE.
  * deprecation: SB-THEAD:GET-MUTEX was deprecated in favor of
    SB-THREAD:GRAB-MUTEX.
  * new contributed module: SB-CONCURRENCY is a new contrib; it's supposed to
    contain additional data structures and tools for concurrent programming;
    at the moment it contains a lock-free queue, and a lock-free mailbox
    implementation.
  * new feature: added SB-THREAD:GRAB-MUTEX; it's like the now deprecated
    GET-MUTEX but takes &key rather than &optional parameters.  Also added
    :TIMEOUT argument to GRAB-MUTEX on non-sb-lutex platforms like Linux and
    BSD.
  * new feature: added SB-THREAD:TRY-SEMAPHORE, a non-blocking variant of
    SB-THREAD:WAIT-ON-SEMAPHORE.

    generic function call.
  * enhancement: SB-BSD-SOCKET improvements
    ** sockets and socket streams now have a more informative printed
       representation based on the corresponding SOCKET-NAME and
       SOCKET-PEERNAME.
    ** SOCKET-MAKE-STREAM once more supports the :AUTO-CLOSE option.
       (lp#540413)
    ** SOCKET-CLOSE now accepts :ABORT argument, which is passed on to
       CL:CLOSE when appropriate, and no longer disassociates the stream
       from the socket if close failed. (lp#543951)
  * improvements to the instrumenting profiler
    ** new feature: report per-function GC overhead. (thanks to John Fremlin)
    ** optimization: counters no longer use locks for the overflow mode.
    ** bug fix: whenever a profiling counter wrapped into overflow mode, it
       incurred an off-by-one miscount.
  * enhancement: improved MAKE-HASH-TABLE documentation (lp#543473)
  * enhancement: improved DEFMETHOD pretty-printing.
  * enhancement: perform range reduction when arguments are too large for
    x87's transcendentals (instead of returning 0). (lp#327192)
  * enhancement: eliminate some spurious TYPE-WARNINGs. Should help with
    some of CL-PPCRE's macros. (lp#570079)
  * enhancement: our machine code is slightly less hostile to valgrind on
    x86-64.
  * enhancement: up-to-date versions of NetBSD-current are supported.  (Thanks
    to Robert Swindells and Aleksej Saushev)
  * bug fix: correct restart text for the continuable error in MAKE-PACKAGE.

    to timeouts could be left in an inconsistent state.
  * bug fix: fix typo in "Reporting Bugs" section of the manual (lp#520366)
  * bug fix: misoptimization of multiplication by one in
    (SB-C::FLOAT-ACCURACY 0) policies.
  * bug fix: miscounts in SB-PROFILE.
  * bug fix: Fix lost wakeup bug between SB-THREAD:CONDITION-WAIT and
    CONDITION-NOTIFY on Linux. See threads "lost wakeup in condition-wait /
    condition-notify" (Feb 2010) and "Condition-Wait, Deadline handler, waking
    up itself" (March 2010) for further details.
  * bug fix: allow forward FIND and POSITION on lists to elide checking :END
    against length of the list if the element is found before the specified
    END is reached. (thanks to Alec Berryman, lp#554385)
  * bug fix: errors signalled during package graph modification no longer
    block FIND-SYMBOL and FIND-PACKAGE in other threads. (lp#511072)

  * bug fix: Transforms for TRUNCATE don't die when the result is completely
    ignored anymore.
  * bug fix: Maybe restore buildability on Alpha.
  * bug fix: READ-BYTE isn't inline anymore, fixing weird streams failures.
    (lp#569404)
  * bug fix: RANDOM-STATE can be printed readably again.
  * bug fix: Unreadable objects were sometimes printed like #<\nFoo>.
  * bug fix: Using EQL with non-constant values of constant type (e.g. EQL
    types) could result in type mismatches during compilation.

    storage vector for multidimensional simple arrays resulting in better code
    for accessing such arrays.

    Bruce O'Neel.
  * bug fix: SB-THREAD:CONDITION-WAIT sometimes signaled a deadline twice
    in a row even though a handler defered the deadline long into the
    future. (lp#512914)
  * bug fix: A deadline handler was run without interrupts enabled for a
    deadline signaled within SB-THREAD:CONDITION-WAIT. That could result
    in infinitely spinning, non-killable threads.
  * bug fix: Backtrace from internal-errors on x86-64 os x was truncated
    before reaching the erring stack frame.
  * bug fix: Fix type derivation for EXPT when raising a fixnum to a
    real power.  (launchpad bug lp#525949)
  * bug fix: Fix SB-EXT:GENERATION-* accessors for generations > 0 on
    GENCGC platforms.  (launchpad bug lp#529014)
  * bug fix: More robust checks for invalid DEFMETHOD argument specializers.
    (launchpad bug lp#525916)
  * bug fix: Fix building on Darwin when sysctl is not in the user's PATH.
    (Thanks to Robert Goldman)

changes in sbcl-1.0.35 relative to sbcl-1.0.34:
  * optimization: ROUND with a single single-float or double-float argument
    is properly inlined when possible.
  * optimization: Slightly better code is generated for integer<->float
    conversions and for single-float<->double-float conversions on x86-64.
  * optimization: SB-ROTATE-BYTE:ROTATE-BYTE now generates more efficient
    code for 32-bit and 64-bit rotations on x86-64.
  * bug fix: The install script changes the ownership of directories as well
    as files for contrib modules using asdf.  (thanks to Eugene Ossintsev;
    launchpad bug lp#508485)
  * bug fix: TRUNCATE with a single single-float or double-float argument is
    properly inlined when possible.  (launchpad bug lp#489388)
  * bug fix: Passing a rotation count of zero to SB-ROTATE-BYTE:ROTATE-BYTE
    no longer causes a compiler error on x86 and ppc.
  * bug fix: GET-MACRO-CHARACTER bogusly computed its second return value
    always relative to *READTABLE* rather than the passed argument.

changes in sbcl-1.0.34 relative to sbcl-1.0.33:
  * minor incompatible change: threading support is now enabled by default
    on x86[-64] Linux.
  * enhancement: SB-INTROSPECT:DEFTYPE-LAMBDA-LIST now also works on most
    builtin types.
  * enhancement: Errors during compile-time-too processing (i.e. EVAL-WHEN)
    are now caught and reported just like errors during macroexpansion.
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now provides access to tcdrain(), tcflow(),
    tcflush(), tcgetsid(), and tcsendbreak(). (thanks to Jerry James)
  * enhancement: ASDF systems can now depends on SB-QUEUE.
  * fixes and improvements related to Unicode and external formats:
    ** bug fix: error handling and restart usage in the ucs-2 external format
       has been improved.
    ** there is now an implementation of the ucs-4 external format.
    ** the utf-16 and utf-32 external formats are supported.
  * bug fix: SB-POSIX wrapper for putenv no longer tries to put lisp strings
    in the environment. setenv() and unsetenv() are also provided. (reported by
    Fare Rideau; launchpad bug lp#460455)
  * bug fix: LOAD of both .fasl and .FASL type files now forces fasl-style
    loading. This ensures sensible errors for .FASL files from other
    implementations on case-insensitive filesystems. (reported by Willem
    Broekema; launchpad bug lp#489417)
  * bug fix: #p"\\\\" can now be read without error on Win32.  (reported by
    Willem Broekema; launchpad bug lp#489698).
  * bug fix: some minor code rearrangements to reenable warning-free building
    from CMUCL (reported by xme@gmx.net; launchpad bug lp#491104)
  * bug fix: PRINT-OBJECT for clos instances respects the right margin when
    pretty printing
  * bug fix: FIND-PACKAGE & DEFPACKAGE were not thread safe. (reported by
    Attila Lendvai)

changes in sbcl-1.0.33 relative to sbcl-1.0.32:
  * new port: support added for x86-64 NetBSD.  (thanks to Aymeric Vincent)
  * improvement: support O_LARGEFILE access to files larger than 2GB on
    x86-64/linux.  (thanks to Daniel Janus; launchpad bug lp#453080)
  * new feature: SB-INTROSPECT:WHO-SPECIALIZES-DIRECTLY to get a list of
    definitions for methods specializing on the passed class itself.
  * new feature: SB-INTROSPECT:WHO-SPECIALIZES-GENERALLY to get a list of
    definitions for methods specializing on the passed class itself, or on
    subclasses of it.
  * new build flag: :sb-xref-for-internals; SBCL will collect xref information
    about itself during the build (e.g. for M-? in Slime), if this flag is
    enabled in customize-target-features.lisp. This will increase the core
    size by about 5-6mb, though, so it's mostly interesting to SBCL
    developers.
  * new feature: various GENCGC tuning parameters have been experimentally
    documented and exported from SB-EXT. See documentation for details.
  * fixes and improvements related to Unicode and external formats:
    ** the Unicode character database has been upgraded to the
       Unicode 5.2 standard, giving names and properties to a number of new
       characters, and providing a few extra characters with case
       transformations.
    ** improvement: restarts for providing replacement input/output on coding
       errors for fd-stream external formats.
    ** improvement: where :<encoding> is a keyword corresponding to an
       external format the system supports, it is now possible to specify
       (:<encoding> :replacement <character>) as an external format which will
       automatically substitute <character> on encoding or decoding errors for
       streams and for STRING-TO-OCTETS and its inverse.  (launchpad bug
       lp#317072)
    ** improvement: the file streams underlying the standard streams (such as
       *STANDARD-INPUT*, *TERMINAL-IO*) are opened with an external format
       which uses the replacement mechanism to handle encoding errors,
       preventing various infinite error chains and unrecoverable I/O
       confusion.
    ** minor incompatible change: the utf-8 external format now correctly
       refuses to encode Lisp characters in the surrogate range (char-codes
       between #xd800 and #xdfff).
    ** fix a typo preventing conversion of strings into octet vectors
       in the latin-2 encoding.  (reported by Attila Lendvai; launchpad bug
       lp#471689)
    ** fix a bug in the octet multibyte handling of decoding errors and the
       USE-VALUE restart.  (launchpad bug lp#314939)
    ** fix the bug underlying the expected failure in the FORCE-END-OF-FILE
       restart on fd-stream decoding errors.
    ** fix a bug in the ATTEMPT-RESYNC fd-stream decoding restart when the
       error is near the end of file.
    ** fix a double-error case in unibyte octet conversions, when the first
       use of USE-VALUE is ignored.
    ** fix bugs in handling of undefined code points in unibyte encodings.
    ** fix LISTEN (and consequent hangs in READ-CHAR-NO-HANG) on bivalent
       streams after an UNREAD-CHAR.
  * enhancement: SB-INTROSPECT:ALLOCATION-INFORMATION also reports if the
    object is allocated in a boxed region of dynamic space.
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX:FORK now signals an error if an attempt to
    fork with multiple Lisp threads running is made, instead of going
    ahead with unpredictable consequences. (reported by Leslie Polzer)
  * bug fix: uses of slot accessors on specialized method parameters within
    the bodies of SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS methods no longer triggers a type
    error while finalizing the class.  This fix may cause classes with slot
    accessors to be finalized later than previously.  (reported by Lars Rune
    Nøstdal; launchpad bug lp#473699)
  * bug fix: restore buildability on the MIPS platform.  (regression from
    1.0.30.38, reported by Samium Gromoff)
  * bug fix: inspecting closures is less likely to fail with a type error.
  * bug fix: no timer starvation when setting the system clock back.
    (launchpad bug lp#460283)
  * bug fix: WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX now binds *PRINT-PPRINT-DISPATCH* to the
    standard pprint dispatch table as specified by CLHS.
  * bug fix: give CLISP a hint about a type declaration to enable it to build
    the cross-compiler without warnings.  (thanks to Josh Elasser; launchpad
    bug lp#396597)
  * bug fix: correctly dump literal objects in defaulting forms of arglists.
    (reported by Attila Lendvai; launchpad bug lp#310132)
  * bug fix: distinguish in type specifiers between arrays that might be
    complex and arrays that are definitely complex.  (launchpad bug lp#309129)
  * bug fix: SUBTYPEP knows that the SYMBOL type is not SUBTYPEP the KEYWORD
    type.  (reported by Levente Mészáros; launchpad bug lp#485972)
  * bug fix: setting the value of a symbol-macro within a method in the
    presence of type declarations works properly again.  (reported by Iban
    Hatchondo; launchpad bug lp#485019)

changes in sbcl-1.0.32 relative to sbcl-1.0.31:
  * optimization: faster FIND and POSITION on strings of unknown element type
    in high SPEED policies. (thanks to Karol Swietlicki)
  * optimization: faster CONCATENATE 'STRING in low SPEED policies (reported
    by David Vázquez)
  * improvement: better error signalling for bogus parameter specializer names
    in DEFMETHOD forms (reported by Pluijzer)
  * bug fix: DELETE-FILE once again works on logical pathnames (regression
    since 1.0.30.49)
  * bug fix: LOGICAL-PATHNAME signals a TYPE-ERROR if pathspec is specified
    incorrectly.
  * bug fix: redefinition of a class via DEFCLASS without :DEFAULT-INITARGS
    removes previous default initargs (reported by Lars Rune Nøstdal and
    Samium Gromoff)
  * bug fix: correct WHO-CALLS information for inlined lambdas with complex
    lambda-lists. (reported by Peter Seibel)
  * bug fix: SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE option :SAVE-RUNTIME-OPTIONS did not work
    correctly when starting from an executable core without saved runtime
    options (reported by Faré Rideau, thanks to Zach Beane)
  * bug fix: (SETF SLOT-VALUE) signalled a warning which should have been
    an optimization note instead. (reported by Martin Cracauer)
  * bug fix: WITH-SLOTS did not work with THE forms. (thanks to David Tolpin)
  * bug fix: Have RUN-PROGRAM with :INPUT T only run the subprocess in a
    new process group if it doesn't need to share stdin with the sbcl
    process. (thanks to Leslie Polzer)
  * bug fix: SATISFIES could be misoptimized to refer to a local function.
    (reported by Stanislaw Halik)

changes in sbcl-1.0.31 relative to sbcl-1.0.30:
  * improvement: stack allocation is should now be possible in all nested
    inlining cases: failure to stack allocate when equivalent code is manually
    open coded is now considered a bug.
  * improvements related to Unicode:
    ** the Unicode character database has been upgraded to the
       Unicode 5.1 standard, giving names and properties to a number of new
       characters, and providing a few extra characters with case
       transformations.
    ** the system now recognizes and produces names for Unicode Hangul
       syllable characters.
    ** the EBCDIC-US external-format is now supported for octet operations
       (as well as for stream operations).
  * new feature: experimental :EMIT-CFASL parameter to COMPILE-FILE can
    be used to output toplevel compile-time effects into a separate .CFASL
    file.
  * optimization: COERCE to VECTOR, STRING, SIMPLE-STRING and recognizable
    one-dimenstional subtypes of ARRAY is upto 70% faster when the coercion is
    actually needed.
  * optimization: TRUNCATE on known single- and double-floats is upto 25%
    faster.
  * optimization: division of floating point numbers by constants uses
    multiplication by reciprocal when an exact reciprocal exists.
  * optimization: multiplication of single- and double-floats floats by
    constant two has been optimized.
  * optimization: ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P is resolved at compile-time when
    sufficient type information is available. (thanks to Leslie Polzer)
  * optimization: SLOT-VALUE and (SETF SLOT-VALUE) with constant slot names on
    known structure objects are as efficient as defstruct generated accessors.
  * optimization: unused vector creation can now be optimized away.
  * improvement: ASDF systems can now depends on SB-INTROSPECT.
  * improvement: a STYLE-WARNING is signalled when a generic function
    clobbers an earlier FTYPE proclamation.
  * improvement: the compiler is able to track the effective type of
    generic function across method addition and removal even in the
    absence of an explicit DEFGENERIC.
  * improvement: DESCRIBE now reports on symbols naming undefined
    but assumed or declared function as well.
  * improvement: recompilation of systems using SB-GROVEL now works
    (thanks to Leslie Polzer)
  * improvements to SB-CLTL2 (thanks to Larry D'Anna):
    ** functions DECLARATION-INFORMATION, PARSE-MACRO, and ENCLOSE have been
       documented.
    ** AUGMENT-ENVIRONMENT and DEFINE-DECLARATION have been implemented.
    ** DECLARATION-INFORMATION now supports declaration name DECLARATION as
       well as user defined declaration names.
    ** VARIABLE-INFORMATION is now aware of alien variables.
  * improvement: improved address space layout on OpenBSD (thanks to Josh
    Elsasser)
  * improvement: pretty-printing of various Lisp forms has been improved
    (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: calls to DECODE-FLOAT and INTEGER-DECODE-FLOAT whose value was
    unused were deleted in safe code. (reported by John Fremlin)
  * bug fix: a failing AVER compiling certain MAKE-ARRAY forms. (reported
    by James Wright)
  * bug fix: some out-of-line array predicates were missing (reported by
    Stelian Ionescu)
  * bug fix: a failing AVER in CONVERT-MV-CALL has been fixed. (thanks to
    Larry D'Anna)
  * bug fix: a failing AVER in %ALLOCATE-CLOSURES conversion has been fixed
    (thanks to Larry D'Anna)
  * bug fix: SLEEP supports times over 100 million seconds on long on OpenBSD
    as well. (reported by Josh Elsasser)
  * bug fix: DELETE-FILE on streams no longer closes the stream with :ABORT T,
    leading to possible attempts to delete the same file twice. See docstring
    on DELETE-FILE for details. (reported by John Fremlin)
  * bug fix: DELETE-FILE once again deletes the file named by the pathname
    designator argument, rather than its truename.  (reported by Luis
    Oliveira)
  * bug fix: the low-level debugger had 32-bit assumptions and was missing
    information about some array types. (thanks to Luis Oliveira)
  * bug fix: moderately complex combinations of inline expansions could
    be miscompiled if the result was declared to be dynamic extent.
  * bug fix: on x86, SAP-REF of sizes greater than 8 bits with offsets of the
    form (+ <variable> <integer>) were miscompiled under certain
    circumstances.
  * bug fix: in some cases no compiler note about failure to stack allocate
    was emitted, even if the objects were in fact heap allocated.
  * bug fix: minor violation of "otherwise inaccessible" rule for stack
    allocation could cause objects users might reasonably expect to
    be heap allocated to be stack allocated.
  * bug fix: DESCRIBE signalled an error for generic functions under
    certain circumstances. (thanks to Leslie Polzer)
  * bug fix: Fixed spelling of an error message.

changes in sbcl-1.0.30 relative to sbcl-1.0.29:
  * minor incompatible change: SB-THREAD:JOIN-THREAD-ERROR-THREAD and
    SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD-ERROR-THREAD have been deprecated in favor
    of SB-THREAD:THREAD-ERROR-THREAD.
  * new contrib module: SB-QUEUE provides thread-safe lockless FIFO queues.
  * new feature: docstrings for local and anonymous functions are no longer
    discarded. (thanks to Leslie Polzer)
  * new feature: SB-THREAD:SYMBOL-VALUE-IN-THREAD provides access to symbol
    values in other threads.
  * new feature: SB-INTROSPECT:ALLOCATION-INFORMATION provides information
    about object allocation.
  * optimization: division of a real float by a complex float is implemented
    with a specialised code sequence.
  * optimization: MAKE-INSTANCE with non-constant class-argument but constant
    keywords is an order of magnitude faster.
  * optimization: MAKE-INSTANCE with constant keyword arguments is x2-4 faster
    in the presence of :AROUND or non-standard primary INITIALIZE-INSTANCE
    methods, and similarly for non-standard metaclass classes as long as there
    are no methods additional on MAKE-INSTANCE.
  * optimization: more efficient type-checks for FIXNUMs when the value
    is known to be a signed word on x86 and x86-64.
  * optimization: compiler now optimizes (EXPT -1 INTEGER), (EXPT -1.0 INTEGER),

    callees.
  * optimization: several character functions are now compiled somewhat more
    efficiently. (reported by Lynn Quam)
  * optimization: the compiler now derives simple types for LOAD-VALUE-FORMs.
  * improvement: less unsafe constant folding in floating point arithmetic,
    especially for mixed complex/real -float operations.
  * optimization: constant double and single floats are stored in native
    unboxed format on x86[-64].
  * optimization: smarter code for arithmetic operations with constant floats,
    complex floats, or integers on x86[-64].
  * optimization: smarter code for conjugate/multiplication of float complexes
    and abs/negate of floats on x86-64.
  * optimization: more efficient complex float and real float operations on
    x86-64.
  * improvement: complex float division is slightly more stable.
  * improvement: DESCRIBE output has been reworked to be easier to read and
    contains more pertinent information.
  * improvement: failure to provide requested stack allocation compiler notes
    provided in all cases (requested stack allocation not happening without a
    note being issued is now considered a bug.)
  * bug fix: SB-POSIX exports the documented types and functions
    FILE-DESCRIPTOR and FILENAME, and also the corresponding -DESCRIPTOR
    types. (reported by "abhi")
  * bug fix: on 64 bit platforms FILL worked incorrectly on arrays with
    upgraded element type (COMPLEX SINGLE-FLOAT), regression from 1.0.28.55.
    (thanks to Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: looping around HANDLER-CASE could silently consume stack space
    on each iteration. (reported by "foobar")
  * bug fix: better error signalling when calls to functions seeking elements
    from lists (eg. ADJOIN) are compiled with both :TEST and :TEST-NOT.
    (reported by Tobias Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: regressions in DIRECTORY from 1.0.28.61: pattern matching of
    directory components now works as it used to. (various prolems reported by
    Michael Becker, Gabriel Dos Reis, Cyrus Harmon, and Harald Hanche-Olsen)
  * bug fix: :PTY option in RUN-PROGRAM was broken with stream arguments.
    (reported by Elliot Slaughter, thanks to Stas Boukarev)
  * bug fix: bogus undefined variable warnings from fopcompiled references to
    global variables. (thanks to Lars Rune Nøstdal)
  * bug fix: foreign function names should now appear in backtraces on
    FC6 as well. (reported by Tomasz Skutnik and Tobias Rautenkranz)
  * bug fix: SETF compiler macro documentation strings are not discarded
    anymore.
  * bug fix: GENTEMP is now unaffected by pretty printer dispatch table.
    (thanks to Alex Plotnick)

    SIGNED-WORD on the assumption that sleeping for 68 years is sufficient
    for anyone. (reported by Leslie Polzer, thanks to Stas Boukarev)
  * bug fix: compiler notes for expensive slot type checks could be emitted
    at runtime MAKE-INSTANCE calls. (reported by Samium Gromoff)

changes in sbcl-1.0.29 relative to 1.0.28:
  * IMPORTANT: bug database has moved from the BUGS file to Launchpad
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl
    Bugs can be reported directly there, or by sending email to
        sbcl-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net
    (no subscription required.)
  * minor incompatible change: under weak type checking policy integer
    types are weakened less aggressively.
  * minor incompatible change: SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE :TOPLEVEL function is now
    allowed to return, which causes SBCL to quit with exit status 0. Previously
    if the function returned with a small integer return value, that value
    was accidentally reused as the exit status.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:DEFINE-HASH-TABLE-TEST allows defining new arguments
    to MAKE-HASH-TABLE :TEST, and MAKE-HASH-TABLE has been extended with
    :HASH-FUNCTION argument. Refer to user manual for details.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:DEFGLOBAL macro allows defining global non-special
    variables.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:GET-TIME-OF-DAY provides access to seconds and
    microseconds since the Unix epoch on all platforms.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:ALWAYS-BOUND proclamation inhibits MAKUNBOUND, and
    allows the compiler to safely elide boundedness checks for special
    variables.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:GLOBAL proclamation inhibits SPECIAL proclamations for
    the symbol, prohibits both lexical and dynamic binding. This is mainly an
    efficiency measure for threaded platforms, but also valueable in
    expressing intent.
  * new feature: UNC pathnames are now understood by the system on Windows.
  * optimization: the compiler uses a specialized version of FILL when the
    element type is know in more cases, making eg. (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) case
    almost 90% faster.
  * optimization: accesses to potentially non-simple arrays where element type
    is known are 50% faster.
  * optimization: compiler now generates faster array typechecking code.
  * optimization: ARRAY-DIMENSION is now faster for multidimensional and
    non-simple arrays.
  * optimization: multidimensional array accesses in the absence of type
    information regarding array rank are approximately 10% faster due to
    open coding of ARRAY-RANK.
  * optimization: result of (FILL (MAKE-ARRAY ...) ...) and (REPLACE
    (MAKE-ARRAY ...) ...) can be stack allocated if the result of MAKE-ARRAY
    form can be.
  * optimization: result of call to VECTOR can now be stack allocated.
  * optimization: MAKE-ARRAY with :INITIAL-CONTENTS is now vastly faster
    as long as the resulting array is one-dimensional and has a known
    element type. In particular, :INITIAL-CONTENTS (LIST ...) where the
    length of the list matches the known length of the vector does not
    allocate the list as an intermediate step. Ditto for VECTOR and simple
    backquoted forms.
  * optimization: MAKE-ARRAY can now stack allocate in the presence of
    :INITIAL-CONTENTS and :INITIAL-ELEMENT as long as the result has a
    known element type, and is known to be simple and one dimensional.
  * improvement: SBCL now emits a compiler note where stack allocation was
    requested but could not be provided (not in all cases, unfortunately)
  * improvement: better MACHINE-VERSION responses. (thanks to Josh Elsasser)
  * improvement: pretty-printing loop has been implemented properly. (thanks
    to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * documentation: CLOS slot typechecing policy has been documented.
  * bug fix: FILE-AUTHOR no longer signals an error on Windows.
  * bug fix: SB-SPROF could be foiled by foreign code not have a frame
    pointer, leading to memory faults. (thanks to Bart Botta)
  * bug fix: better floating point exception handling on x86/OpenBSD.
    (thanks to Josh Elsasser)
  * bug fix: exit status from QUIT when called under --script was lost
    (reported by Hubert Kauker)
  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY for non-zero :INITIAL-ELEMENT always used the
    same implementation of FILL to initialize the array, even if a more
    efficient one was available (reported by Stas Boukarev, thanks to
    Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: potential miscompilation of array stack allocation on x86 and
    x86-64. (reported by Time Tossavainen)
  * bug fix: some forms of AND, OR, and COND resulted in expansions that could
    result in their subforms being treated as top level forms. (reported by
    James Knight)
  * bug fix: On x86/x86-64 alien functions declared to return integers shorter
    than a machine register could leave garbage in the high bits of the
    result register (bug 316325).
  * bug fix: disable address space randomization Linux/x86-64 as well,
    not just x86-64. (reported by Ken Olum)
  * bug fix: Attempting to DEREF an (ALIEN (* T)) would produce a WARNING and
    generate incorrect code.
  * bug fix: #201; type inference for CONS and ARRAY types could derive
    wrong results in the presence of eg. RPLACA or ADJUST-ARRAY.
  * bug fix: special variables with a proclaimed specific subtype of FUNCTION
    could not be assigned to or bound with PROGV. (reported by Lorenz
    Mösenlechner)
  * bug fix: the value of CL:- in the inspector was the previous expression
    evaluated rather than the expression being evaluated.
  * bug fix: constants can no longer be locally declared special.
  * bug fix: signals delivered to threads started from foreign land (read:
    directly by pthread_create, not by MAKE-THREAD) are redirected to a Lisp
    thread by blocking all signals and resignalling.
  * bug fix: SHARED-INITIALIZE initialized unbound :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots
    from :INITFORM, if any.

changes in sbcl-1.0.28 relative to 1.0.27:
  * a number of bugs in cross-compilation have been fixed, with the ultimate
    result that building under (at least) clisp should be much more reliable.
  * minor incompatible changes: echo-streams now propagate unread-char to the
    underlying input stream, and no longer permit unreading more than one
    character.
  * improvement: on x86/x86-64 Lisp call frames now have the same layout as C
    frames, allowing for instance more reliable backtraces.
  * improvement: the debugger REPL can now reference lexical variables
    by name directly for code compiled with (DEBUG 3).
  * improvement: errors from malformed declarations now have better source
    paths associated with them. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * optimization: faster local calls on x86/x86-64
  * bug fix: some error messages for out-of-bound array indexes confused the
    index and the bound. (thanks to Stas Boukarev)
  * bug fix: pretty printing malformed DEFPACKAGE forms (thanks to Sidney
    Markowitz)
  * bug fix: running regressions tests in shells without OSTYPE set now works.
    (reported by Harald Hanche-Olsen)
  * bug fix: more robust static space exhaustion signalling from
    MAKE-STATIC-VECTOR (thanks to Daniel Lowe)
  * bug fix: (SETF DOCUMENTATION) for anonymous function now throws the
    docstring away instead of storing it under names such as (LAMBDA (X)).
    (reported by Leslie Polzer)
  * bug fix: timers could go off in the wrong order, be delayed indefinitely
    (thanks to Ole Arndt for the patch)
  * bug fix: RESTART-FRAME and RETURN-FROM-FRAME stack corruption
  * bug fix: the discriminating function for PRINT-OBJECT no longer preserves
    potentially-invalid effective methods in its cache.
  * bug fix: SB-INTROSPECT:FIND-DEFINITION-SOURCE now works with funcallable
    instances as well (thanks to Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: using RUN-PROGRAM does not interfere with SB-POSIX:WAIT,
    SB-POSIX:WAITPID and their C equivalents.
  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM does not crash on Darwin when stressed.

changes in sbcl-1.0.27 relative to 1.0.26:
  * new port: support added for x86-64 OpenBSD. (thanks to Josh Elsasser)
  * new port: support added for x86-64 Solaris. (thanks to Alex Viskovatoff)
  * improvement: the system either recovers from stack exhaustion or dies
    properly as opposed to leaving the user uncertain of whether the handler
    trampled on some random memory next to the stack or having to rely on
    --lose-on-corruption (which is still a good idea to use in production
    because stack exhaustion can happen in signal handlers which will likely
    lead to hangs.)
  * bug fix: fix gc related interrupt handling bug on ppc (regression from
    1.0.25.37, reported by Harald Hanche-Olsen)
  * bug fix: work around signal delivery bug in darwin (regression from
    1.0.25.44, reported by Sidney Markowitz)
  * bug fix: fix ERROR leaking memory (reported by David Thompson)

changes in sbcl-1.0.26 relative to 1.0.25:
  * incompatible change: an interruption (be it a function passed to
    INTERRUPT-THREAD or a timer function) runs in an environment where
    interrupts can be enabled. The interruption can use
    WITH-INTERRUPTS or WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS as it sees fit. Use
    WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS to avoid nesting of interruptions and
    potentially running out of stack. Keep in mind that in the absence
    of WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS some potentially blocking operation such as
    acquiring a lock can enable interrupts.
  * incompatible change: GC-OFF and GC-ON are removed, as they were
    always unsafe. Use WITHOUT-GCING instead.
  * new feature: runtime option --disable-ldb
  * new feature: runtime option --lose-on-corruption to die at the
    slightest hint of possibly non-recoverable errors: running out of
    memory, stack, alien stack, binding stack, encountering a memory
    fault, etc. In the absence of --lose-on-corruption a warning is
    printed to stderr.
  * enhancement: detect binding stack exhaustion
  * enhancement: detect alien stack exhaustion on x86/x86-64
  * improvement: generally more stable and reliable interrupt handling
  * improvement: there is a per thread interruption queue,
    interruptions are executed in order of arrival
  * improvement: a repeating timer reschedules itself when the it has
    finished, but expiration times are spaced equally. If an
    expiration time is in the past it will trigger after a short grace
    period that may give a chance to other things to run.
  * optimization: slightly faster gc on multithreaded builds
  * optimization: faster WITHOUT-GCING
  * bug fix: when JOIN-THREAD signals an error, do it when not holding
    important locks so that the debugger/handler doesn't produce
    recursive errors or deadlock.
  * bug fix: real-time signals are not used anymore, so no more
    hanging when the system wide real-time signal queue gets full.
  * bug fix: INTERRUPT-THREAD on a dying thread could produce memory
    fault.
  * bug fix: finalizers, gc hooks never run in a WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS
  * bug fix: fix random memory faults related to interrupts on alpha
  * bug fix: fix random memory faults related to interrupts on sparc
  * bug fix: fix deadlocks related to starting threads
  * bug fix: fix deadlines on locks on futex platforms
  * bug fix: restore errno in signal handlers
  * bug fix: fix deadlocks related to hash tables
  * bug fix: fix deadlocks in pcl

changes in sbcl-1.0.25 relative to 1.0.24:
  * incompatible change: SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-ARGLIST is deprecated, to be
    removed later. Please use SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-LAMBDA-LIST instead.
  * new feature: SB-INTROSPECT:DEFTYPE-LAMBDA-LIST allows retrieval of
    DEFTYPE lambda lists. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * enhancement: MUTEX-VALUE is to be superseded by MUTEX-OWNER that has a
    better name and does not return values so stale on multiprocessor systems.
    Also, HOLDING-MUTEX-P was added for about the only sane usage of
    MUTEX-OWNER.
  * improvement: unithread builds keep track of MUTEX-VALUE.
  * improvement: reading from a TWO-WAY-STREAM does not touch the output
    stream anymore making it thread safe to have a concurrent reader and
    a writer, for instance, in a pipe.
  * improvement: GET-SETF-EXPANDER avoids adding bindings for constant
    arguments, making compiler-macros for SETF-functions able to inspect
    their constant arguments.
  * improvement: COMPILE-FILE reports times with millisecond accuracy
    (thanks to Luis Oliveira)
  * optimization: CHAR-CODE type derivation has been improved, making
    TYPEP elimination on subtypes of CHARACTER work better. (reported
    by Tobias Rittweiler, patch by Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: setting alien structure fields of type struct by value now
    computes the right offset for the memory copy.
  * bug fix: compilation problem involving inlined calls to aliens with
    result type VOID. (reported by Ken Olum)
  * bug fix: #235a; sequential inline expasion in different policies no
    longer reuses the functional from the previous expansion site.
  * bug fix: DEFTYPE no longer breaks on bodies consisting of a single
    unquoted symbol. Regression from 1.0.22.8. (reported by Ariel Badichi)
  * bug fix: named ENUMs in multiply-referenced alien record types no longer
    cause an implied type redefinition.  Regression from 1.0.21.29.
  * bug fix: sign-extension of small signed return values now works with C
    code compiled with gcc 4.3 or newer. (reported by Liam Healy)
  * improvements to the Windows port:
    ** SB-BSD-SOCKETS now works from saved cores as well. (reported by Stephen
       Westfold, thanks to Rudi Schlatte)

  * new feature: ARRAY-STORAGE-VECTOR provides access to the underlying data
    vector of a multidimensional SIMPLE-ARRAY.

    argument :RESOLVE-SYMLINKS. (thanks to TC-Rucho)
  * enhancement: SB-BSD-SOCKETS:MAKE-SOCKET-STREAM keyword argument handling
    has been robustified and documented better. (thanks to Robert Goldman)
  * optimization: faster generic arithmetic dispatch on x86 and x86-64.
  * optimization: FORMAT ~D and ~F are now approximately 5% faster.
  * tradeoff: constant FORMAT control strings are now compiled unless
    SPACE > SPEED (previously only when SPEED > SPACE.)
  * bug fix: Red Hat Enterprise 3 mmap randomization workaround. (thanks
    to Thomas Burdick)
  * bug fix: DEFCLASS and ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS are now expected to
    be thread safe.
  * bug fix: lexical type declarations are now correctly reported by
    SB-CLTL2. (reported by Larry D'Anna)
  * bug fix: STRING-TO-OCTETS did not handle :START properly when
    using UTF-8 as external format. (thanks to Luis Oliveira)
  * bug fix: errors from invalid fill-pointer values to (SETF FILL-POINTER)
    are signalled correctly. (thanks to Stas Boukarev)
  * bug fix: SET-MACRO-CHARACTER accepts NIL as the readtable
    designator. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: SET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER accepts NIL as the readtable
    designator, and returns T instead of the function. (thanks to
    Tobias Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: direct superclasses of STANDARD-CLASS and
    FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS now default to STANDARD-OBJECT and
    FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-OBJECT as required by AMOP.
  * bug fix: compiling a call to SLOT-VALUE with a constant slot-name
    when no class with the named slot yet exists no longer causes a
    compile-time style-warning.
  * bug fix: :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots are type-checked properly
    in safe code. (reported by Didier Verna)
  * bug fix: #430; nested structure constructors can stack allocate.
  * bug fix: on some 64-bit platforms dynamic space size was truncated
    to #xffff0000 bytes. (reported by Benjamin Lambert)
  * bug fix: setting *READ-SUPPRESS* to T no longer renders the default
    REPL unusable. (reported by Daniel Herring)
  * bug fix: return values of READ-SEQUENCE did not take :START into
    account on file streams, regressions since 1.0.12.22. (reported by
    Thomas Russ, patch by Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: using SET or (SETF SYMBOL-VALUE) to change the value of a
    method specializer used to confuse permuation vector optimization.
  * bug fix: system inserted bogus implicit type declarations for local
    special variables in DEFMETHOD bodies.
  * bug fix: #354; duplicated frames in backtraces due to
    non-tail-call-optimized XEPs to functions with return type NIL
    have been elimited.
  * bug fix: #357; MAKE-INSTANCE/SHARED-INITIALIZE now
    initializes structure object slots according to DEFSTRUCT initforms,
    and DEFSTRUCT forms :INCLUDEind structure classes defined using
    DEFCLASS :METACLASS STRUCTURE-CLASS now inherit their initforms.
    (reported by Bruno Haible and Stephen Wilson)
  * bug fix: #395; fill-pointer output streams used now support
    element-type BASE-CHAR as well.
  * bug fix: compiler error when attempting to derive return value of
    ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE when the array type was a union of intersection
    types.
  * bug fix: address-spaces overlapped on OpenBSD. (thanks to Josh
    Elsasser)
  * bug fix: Mac OS X binaries should now be portable between Leopard
    and Tiger.

changes in sbcl-1.0.23 relative to 1.0.22:
  * enhancement: when disassembling method functions, disassembly
    for the associated fast function is also produced.
  * enhancement: system stores DEFTYPE lambda-lists, so DESCRIBE can
    report them.
  * optimization: printing with *PRINT-PRETTY* true is now more
    efficient as long as the object being printed doesn't require
    special handling by the pretty printer.
  * bug fix: slot symbol-macros from WITH-SLOTS inside DEFMETHOD bodies
    now interact correctly with type declarations.
  * partial bug fix: PCL detects infinite recursion during wrapper
    validation. (thanks to Attila Lendvai)
  * bug fix: #426; nested function calls are inlined properly.
    Previously if FOO was an inline function, in calls of the form
    (FOO (FOO ...)) the outer call was not inlined.
  * bug fix: long long arguments passed in registers to alien
    functions on PowerPC Linux and NetBSD are now handled correctly
    when preceded by SYSTEM-AREA-POINTERs. (reported by Josh Elsasser)

changes in sbcl-1.0.22 relative to 1.0.21:
  * minor incompatible change: LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT no longer by default looks
    for the shared object in the current directory, but passes the native
    namestring of the designated pathname to the operation system's shared
    object loading function as-it.
  * minor incompatible change: --disable-debugger toplevel option now takes
    effect before processing of initialization files and --eval or --load
    options.
  * new feature: new commandline argument: --script, which supports
    shebang lines. See documentation for details. (based on work by
    Kevin Reid)
  * new feature: SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE can save current values of
    --dynamic-space-size and --control-stack-size in the executable core,
    causing it to skip normal runtime option processing. See documentation
    for details. (thanks to Zach Beane)
  * enhancement: inoccous calls to EVAL or generic functions dispatching
    on subclasses of eg. STREAM no longer cause compiler notes to appear.
  * enhancement: the system no longer resignals errors from --load and
    --eval toplevel arguments as SIMPLE-ERRORS, which caused restarts
    associated with the original error to be lost. (thanks to Ariel
    Badichi)
  * enhancement: :DONT-SAVE keyword argument has been added to
    LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT for controlling interaction with
    SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE, and UNLOAD-SHARED-OBJECT can be used to undo
    the effects of an earlier LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT call.
  * bug fix: ADJUST-ARRAY on multidimensional arrays used bogusly give
    them a fill pointer unless :DISPLACED-TO or :INITIAL-CONTENTS were
    provided. (reported by Cedric St-Jean)
  * bug fix: circularity handling in the reader did not treat raw
    structure slots correctly. (reported by Cedric St-Jean)
  * bug fix: SERVE-EVENT occasionally signaled an error about bogus
    file descriptors when there were none.
  * bug fix: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO support of destructuring lambda-lists
    was broken. (reporteed by Willem Broekema)
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:NATIVE-NAMESTRING on Windows did not work on
    pathnames without a directory.
  * bug fix: COMPILE-FILE did not warn about undefined variable
    references at toplevel, and LOAD of the resulting fasl did
    not signal an error.
  * bug fix: functions with non-required arguments used to end up with
    (SB-C::&OPTIONAL-DISPATCH ...) as their name.
  * bug fix: redefining a function with non-required arguments didn't
    update the system's knowledge about its call signature properly.
  * bug fix: fixed #431; incompatible alien record type redefinitions
    are detected and handled. (reported by Neil Haven)
  * bug fix: using RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY with DEBUG 3 could cause
    PROGV miscompilation. (reported by Matthias Benkard, patch by Juho
    Snellman)
  * bug fix: on x86 and x86-64 backtraces were sometimes truncated
    after alien stack frames.
  * bug fix: strings passed to mk{s,d}temp lacked null termination

    generic function across method addition and removal.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:ATOMIC-INCF allows atomic incrementation of
    appropriately typed structure slots without locking.
  * new feature: SB-EXT:CALL-WITH-TIMING provides access to timing

    interface.
  * new feature: TIME reports time taken even if the form performs a
    non-local transfer of control.
  * enhancement: reduced conservativism on GENCGC platforms: on
    average 45% less pages pinned (measured from SBCL self build).
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP on SYMBOL-VALUE can no longer
    mutate constant symbols or violate declaimed type of the symbol.
  * bug fix: SB-THREAD:SIGNAL-SEMAPHORE could fail to wakeup threads
    sleeping on the semaphore in heavily contested semaphores.
  * bug fix: semaphores and condition variables were not interrupt
    safe.
  * bug fix: SB-THREAD:CONDITION-WAIT doesn't allow waits on mutexes
    owned by other threads anymore.
  * bug fix: FIND on lists called KEY outside the specified
    subsequence. (reported by budden)
  * bug fix: LOG doesn't use single-float intermediate results when
    given mixed integer and double-float arguments, leading to better
    precision. (reported by Bob Felts)
  * bug fix: LOG with base zero returned values of inconsistent type.

changes in sbcl-1.0.20 relative to 1.0.19:
  * minor incompatible change: OPTIMIZE qualities
    SB-C::STACK-ALLOCATE-DYNAMIC-EXTENT, SB-C::STACK-ALLOCATE-VECTOR,

    to more efficient EQ-comparison versions more often.
  * optimization: enhanced derivation of DOLIST iteration variable type
    for constant lists.
  * optimization: constant folding of simple (LIST ...) forms as DOLIST
    arguments.
  * optimization: runtime lookup of function definitions can be
    elided in more cases, eg: (let ((x 'foo)) (funcall foo)).
  * optimization: compiler is able to derive the return type of

  * optimization: CLRHASH on empty hash-tables no longer does pointless
    work. (thanks to Alec Berryman)
  * optimization: REPLACE deftransforms don't punt when :START1 or
    :START2 is given
  * bug fix: compiling DESTRUCTURING-BIND on constant list arguments
    no longer emits a code deletion note. (reported by Andrew
    Gasparovic)
  * bug fix: bogus odd-number-of-keywords STYLE-WARNINGs from calls to
    functions with an odd number of &OPTIONAL arguments, a &REST
    argument, and one or more &KEY arguments at the call site.
  * bug fix: STYLE-WARNINGs for functions with both &OPTIONAL and &KEY
    arguments appeared at call sites as well.
  * bug fix: fixed #425; CLOSE drops input buffers from streams, so
    READ-LINE &co can no longer read from them afterwards. (reported
    by Damien Cassou)

    of the type that's the value of this variable.
  * optimization: stack allocation is slightly more efficient on x86
    and x86-64.
  * bug fix: DEFSTRUCT forms with user-specified :CONSTRUCTOR options,

    correctly. (reported by John Morrison)
  * bug fix: compiler no longer makes erronous assumptions in the
    presence of non-foldable SATISFIES types.

    ** adjusted address spaces for building on both Win32 and
       Win64. (thanks for John Connors)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:

       to single-float coercions.
    ** arithmetic operations involving large integers and single
       floats give the same results in compiled and interpreted code.
    ** deriving the result type of COERCE no longer signals an error
       if the derived type of the second argument is a MEMBER type
       containing invalid type specifiers.
    ** ADJOIN with constant NIL as second argument works correctly.
    ** FUNCTION-KEYWORDS was called SB-PCL::FUNCTION-KEYWORD-PARAMETERS.

changes in sbcl-1.0.18 relative to 1.0.17:
  * minor incompatible change: SB-SPROF:WITH-PROFILING now by default
    profiles only the current thread.
  * minor incompatible change: changes to SYMBOL-VALUE of constants
    defined with DEFCONSTANT now signal an error.
  * enhancement: SB-SPROF now has support for wallclock profiling,
    and is also able to profile specific threads. REPORT output
    has also additional sorting options.
  * enhancement: better pretty-printing of DEFPACKAGE forms.  (Thanks
    to Michael Weber)
  * optimization: structure allocation has been improved
    ** constructors created by non-toplevel DEFSTRUCTs are ~40% faster.
    ** out of line constructors are ~10% faster.
    ** inline constructors are ~15% faster.
    ** inline constructors are capable of dynamic extent allocation
       (generally on x86 and x86-64, in some cases on other platforms
       as well.)
  * optimization: simple uses of HANDLER-CASE and HANDLER-BIND no
    longer cons.

  * optimization: code defining methods on PRINT-OBJECT (and other
    generic functions in the COMMON-LISP package) now loads faster.
  * bug fix: EAI_NODATA is deprecated since RFC 3493. Stop using it
    in sb-bsd-sockets.
  * bug fix: if COMPILE-FILE aborts due to an unwind, the partial
    fasl is now deleted. (reported by Attila Lendvai)

    use this feature in the meanwhile.
  * new feature: runtime argument --control-stack-size can be used to
    adjust thread default control stack size.
  * enhancement: improved TIME output
    ** all times are reported using the measured accuracy (milliseconds
       for real and GC times, microseconds for everything else.)

    ** interpreted forms are counted for both evaluator modes.
    ** number of lambdas converted by the compiler is reported.

  * optimization: binding special variables now generates smaller code
    on threaded platforms.
  * optimization: MEMBER and ASSOC are over 50% faster for :TEST #'EQ
    and cases where no :TEST is given but the compiler can infer that
    the element to search is of type (OR FIXNUM (NOT NUMBER)).
  * optimization: better LOGNOT on fixnums.

    is implemented using a tagged representation unless a better
    representation is available.

  * bug fix: XREF accounts for the last node of each basic-block as
    well.
  * bug fix: MAKE-INSTANCE optimizations interacted badly with
    non-keyword :DEFAULT-INITARGS in the presence of :BEFORE/:AFTER
    methods on SHARED-INITIALIZE.  (thanks to Matt Marjanovic)
  * bug fix: the CTOR optimization for MAKE-INSTANCE should no longer
    create obsolete instances in the case of redefinition or
    obsoletion of a superclass.  (thanks to Andy Hefner)
  * bug fix: Support for the Alpha architecture has been revived; it had
    suffered somewhat from lack of maintenance since sbcl-1.0.
  * improvements to the Windows port:
     ** The system detects the codepage to use at startup, instead of
        using the value from the saved core. (thanks to Kei Suzuki)

changes in sbcl-1.0.14 relative to sbcl-1.0.13:
  * new feature: SB-EXT:*EXIT-HOOKS* are called when the process exits
    (see documentation for details.)
  * revived support for OpenBSD (contributed by Josh Elsasser)
  * partially fixed bug #108: ROOM no longer suffers from occasional
    (AVER (SAP= CURRENT END)) failures.
  * fixed bug #402: proclaimed non-standard declarations in DEFMETHOD
    bodies no longer cause a WARNING to be signalled. (reported by
    Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * bug fix: (TRUNCATE X 0) when X is a bignum now correctly signals
    DIVISION-BY-ZERO. Similarly for MOD and REM (which suffered due to
    the bug in TRUNCATE.) (reported by Michael Weber)
  * bug fix: SB-SPROF:REPORT no longer signals an error if there are
    no samples. (reported by Andy Hefner)
  * bug fix: functions compiled using (COMPILE NIL '(LAMBDA ...))
    no longer appear as (NIL ...) frames in backtraces.
  * bug fix: RESOLVE-CONFLICT (and the other name conflict machinery)
    is now actually exported from SB-EXT as documented.  (reported by
    Maciej Katafiasz)
  * bug fix: sb-aclrepl now correctly understands how to inspect
    single-floats on 64-bit platforms where single-floats are not boxed.
  * bug fix: SB-MOP:CLASS-SLOTS now signals an error if the class has not
    yet been finalized. (reported by Levente Meszaros)
  * bug fix: CLOSE :ABORT T behaves more correctly on Windows.
  * DESCRIBE and (DOCUMENTATION ... 'OPTIMIZE) describe meaning of
    SBCL-specific optimize qualities.

changes in sbcl-1.0.13 relative to sbcl-1.0.12:
  * minor incompatible change: RUN-PROGRAM now uses execvp(3) to find
    an executable in the search path, and does so in the child
    process's PATH.  The function FIND-EXECUTABLE-IN-SEARCH-PATH has
    been removed; it can be found in the CVS history, for somebody who
    needs that search behavior (see the manual).
  * minor incompatible change: compiler policy re. weakening type
    checks has changed: now type checks are weakened only if SAFETY < 2
    and SAFETY < SPEED.
  * SB-EXT:NATIVE-NAMESTRING takes a new keyword AS-FILE, forcing
    unparsing of directory pathnames as files. Analogously,
    SB-EXT:PARSE-NATIVE-NAMESTRING takes an AS-DIRECTORY, forcing a
    filename to parse into a directory pathname.
  * enhancement: implicit generic function creation now signals a
    specific style-warning IMPLICIT-GENERIC-FUNCTION-WARNING, which
    users can bind handlers for and muffle around calls to LOAD.
  * enhancement: RUN-PROGRAM allows unicode arguments and environments
    to be used (using the default stream external format), and allows
    non-simple strings to be used. (thanks to Harald Hanche-Olsen)
  * optimization: COPY-SEQ, FILL, and SUBSEQ are 30-80% faster for
    strings and vectors whose element-type or simplicity is not fully
    known at compile-time.
  * optimization: STRING-TRIM and related functions no longer allocate
    a new string when no trimming needs to be performed. These functions
    are also faster than before when the input string has been declared
    as a simple-string.
  * optimization: READ-SEQUENCE on simple-strings is up to 80% faster.
  * optimization: READ-LINE is significantly faster for files containing
    long lines.
  * optimization: non-open coded uses of character comparison operators
    (e.g. char=) no longer cons when called with more than one parameter
    on platforms supporting dynamic-extent allocation.
  * bug fix: READ-SEQUENCE on composite stream wrapping a Gray stream
    with STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) signalled an error.
  * bug fix: COPY-SEQ on lists did not signal a type-error on improper
    lists in safe code.
  * bug fix: some sequence functions elided bounds checking when
    SPEED > SAFETY.
  * bug fix: too liberal weakening of union-type checks when SPEED >
    SAFETY.
  * bug fix: more bogus fixnum declarations in ROOM implementation
    have been fixed.

changes in sbcl-1.0.12 relative to sbcl-1.0.11:
  * new feature: MAKE-HASH-TABLE now experimentally accepts a
    :SYNCHRONIZED argument, which makes the hash-table safe for
    concurrent accesses (but not iteration.) See also:
    SB-EXT:WITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE, and
    SB-EXT:HASH-TABLE-SYNCHRONIZED-P.
  * optimization: CONCATENATE on strings is an order of magnitude faster
    in code compiled with (> SPEED SPACE).
  * optimization: SUBSEQ is ~50% faster on lists.
  * bug fix: bug 417 fixed -- source location reporting is now more robust.
  * bug fix: SUBSEQ on a list will now correctly signal an error if if
    END is smaller then START.
  * bug fix: SB-PROFILE will no longer report extra consing for nested
    calls to profiled functions.
  * bug fix: ROOM implementation had bogus fixnum declarations which
    could cause type-errors when calling ROOM on large images.
  * bug fix: if file compilation is aborted, the partial fasl is now
    deleted, and COMPILE-FILE returns NIL as the primary value.
  * bug fix: number of thread safety issues relating to SBCL's internal
    hash-table usage have been fixed.
  * bug fix: SB-SYS:WITH-PINNED-OBJECTS could cause garbage values to
    be returned from its body when the values were being returned
    using unknown-values return convection and the W-P-O was wrapped
    inside an UNWIND-PROTECT.
  * bug fix: sb-posix should now compile again under Windows, enabling
    slime to work again.

changes in sbcl-1.0.11 relative to sbcl-1.0.10:
  * incompatible change: hash-table accessor functions are no longer
    automatically protected by locks. Concurrent accesses on the same hash-table
    from multiple threads can give inconsistent results or even corrupt the
    hash-table completely. Multi-threaded applications should do their own
    locking at the correct granularity. In the current implementation it is
    still safe to have multiple readers access the same table, but it's not
    guaranteed that this property will be maintained in future releases.
  * minor incompatible change: (SETF MUTEX-VALUE) is not longer supported,
    and will signal an error at runtime.
  * enhancement: SB-THREAD package now exports a semaphore interface.
  * enhancement: CONS can now stack-allocate on x86 and
    x86-64. (Earlier LIST and LIST* supported stack-allocation, but
    CONS did not.)
  * enhancement: nested lists can now be stack allocated on
    platforms providing stack allocation support.
  * enhancement: dynamic-extent support has been extended to support
    cases where there are multiple possible sources for the stack
    allocated value.
  * optimization: RELEASE-MUTEX no longer needs to perform a syscall
    if the mutex is uncontested on Linux.
  * bug fix: symbol-macro expansion now uses the *MACROEXPAND-HOOK*
    as specified by the CLHS. (thanks to Tobias Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: NaN comparison now works on x86-64.
  * bug fix: CLOSE :ABORT T on a stream with pending output now
    works.
  * bug fix: instances of non-standard metaclasses using standard
    instance structure protocol sometimes missed the slot type checks
    in safe code.
  * bug fix: known functions can be inlined in high-debug code.

changes in sbcl-1.0.10 relative to sbcl-1.0.9:
  * minor incompatible change: the MSI installer on Windows no longer
    associates .lisp and .fasl files with the installed SBCL.
  * minor incompatible change: :UNIX is no longer present in *FEATURES*
    on Windows. (thanks to Luis Oliviera)
  * new feature: SB-CLTL2 contrib module now implements
    FUNCTION-INFORMATION. (thanks to Larry D'Anna)
  * optimization: scavenging weak pointers is now more efficient,
    requiring O(1) instead of O(N) per weak pointer to identify
    scanvenged vs. unscavenged pointers. (thanks to Paul Khuong)
  * optimization: typechecking (SETF SLOT-VALUE) is now ~5x faster in
    method bodies using constant slot-names when the first argument is
    a specializer parameter for the method.
  * optimization: SLOT-VALUE &co are now ~50% faster for variable slot
    names, when the class of the instance is a direct instance
    STANDARD-CLASS or FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS (making them only 3x
    as slow as the constant slot-name case.)
  * optimization: member type construction is now O(N) instead
    of O(N^2).
  * optimization: UNION and NUNION are now O(N+M) for large
    inputs as long as the :TEST function is one of EQ, EQL, EQUAL, or
    EQUALP.
  * enhancement: DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO lambda-list information is
    now more readable in environments like Slime which display it.
    (thanks to Tobias C. Rittweiler)
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP was non-atomic unless the compiler
    was able to infer the correct argument type for the object on which
    the CAS operation was being performed.
  * bug fix: copy propagation interfered with parallel assignment
    semantics in local calls. (reported by Paul Khuong)
  * bug fix: the signed modular fixnum shift compiled to wrong code on
    x86 and x86-64.  (spotted by a slight modification to some of
    PFD's random tests)

changes in sbcl-1.0.9 relative to sbcl-1.0.8:
  * minor incompatible change: SB-SYS:OUTPUT-RAW-BYTES is deprecated.
  * enhancement: SB-EXT:FINALIZE accepts a :DONT-SAVE keyword argument,
    indicating the finalizer should be cancelled when SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE
    is called.
  * enhancement: default PRINT-OBJECT methods for classes, slot-definitions,
    and generic function now print the object identity for anonymous
    instances. (thanks to Attila Lendvai)
  * enhancement: as an extension to MOP, SBCL now supports SETF of
    STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-INSTANCE-ACCESS.
    (thanks to Attila Lendvai)
  * enhancement: sb-cover has an alternate annotation mode which puts
    the form annotations at the car of the form, instead of annotating
    it completely. The benefit of this mode is that it shows better
    which forms were instrumented by the compiler.
  * bug fix: new compiler transforms for MEMBER and ASSOC were affected
    by printer control variables. (reported by Dan Corkill)
  * bug fix: system leaked memory when delayed output was performed by
    the OS in smaller chunks then expected. (thanks to David Smith)
  * bug fix: system leaked memory when file streams were not closed
    properly.
  * bug fix: large objects written to slow streams that were modified
    after the write could end up with the modified state written to
    the underlying file descriptor.
  * bug fix: multiple threads operating in parallel on the same stream
    could cause buffer-overflows.
  * bug fix: source location information is stored correctly
    (broken since 1.0.6). This bug would generally show up as the
    Slime debugger highlighting the wrong form when the sldb-show-source
    command was used.
  * bug fix: Branch forms are again annotated as branches in the sb-cover
    annotations.
  * bug fix: GCD on MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM no longer causes an infinite loop
    on x86-64. (reported by Gregory Vanuxem)
  * bug fix: EQUALP could return wrong results for structures with raw
    slots (slots with a :TYPE of SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT, or a machine
    word). (reported by Vjacheslav Fyodorov)
  * bug fix: sb-sprof sampling didn't work on non-x86oid platforms. (patch
    by Pierre Mai)

changes in sbcl-1.0.8 relative to sbcl-1.0.7:
  * enhancement: experimental macro SB-EXT:COMPARE-AND-SWAP provides
    atomic compare-and-swap operations on threaded platforms.
  * enhancement: experimental function SB-EXT:RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY
    allows assigning a global minimum value to optimization qualities
    (overriding proclamations and declarations).
  * enhancement: closed over variables can be stack-allocated on x86
    and x86-64.
  * performance bug fix: GETHASH and (SETF GETHASH) are once again
    non-consing.
  * optimization: slot definition lookup is now O(1). This speeds up
    eg. SLOT-VALUE and (SETF SLOT-VALUE) with variable slot names.
  * optimization: STRING-TO-OCTETS is now up to 60% faster for UTF-8.
  * optimization: ASSOC and MEMBER can now be open-coded for all
    combinations of keyword arguments when second argument is constant
    and SPEED >= SPACE. In other cases a specialized version is
    selected.
  * bug fix: using obsoleted structure instances with TYPEP and
    generic functions now signals a sensible error.
  * bug fix: threads waiting on GET-FOREGROUND can be interrupted.
    (reported by Kristoffer Kvello)
  * bug fix: backtrace construction is now more careful when making
    lisp-objects from pointers on the stack, to avoid creating bogus
    objects that can be seen by the GC.
  * bug fix: defaulting of values in contexts expecting more than 7
    variables now works on x86-64.  (reported by Christopher Laux)
  * bug fix: modifications to packages (INTERN, EXPORT, etc) are now
    thread safe.
  * bug fix: (SETF SYMBOL-PLIST) no longer allows assigning a non-list
    as the property-list of a symbol.
  * bug fix: DEFMETHOD forms with CALL-NEXT-METHOD in the method body,
    in EVAL-WHEN forms with both :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL and :LOAD-TOPLEVEL
    situations requested, are once again file-compileable.  (reported
    by Sascha Wilde)

changes in sbcl-1.0.7 relative to sbcl-1.0.6:
  * MOP improvement: support for user-defined subclasses of
    SB-MOP:SPECIALIZER has been enhanced.  The experimental interface
    function SB-PCL:MAKE-METHOD-SPECIALIZERS-FORM, called as part of
    the expansion of DEFMETHOD, is responsible for generating a form
    which creates a list of specializers when evaluated.  Additional
    functions SB-PCL:[UN]PARSE-SPECIALIZER-USING-CLASS provide
    debugging and introspective support.
  * minor incompatible change: the (unsupported) spinlock interface
    has changed: free spinlock now has the value NIL, and a held spinlock
    has the owning thread as its value.
  * enhancement: WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS now binds ALLOW-WITH-INTERRUPTS and
    WITH-LOCAL-INTERRUPTS as local macros. Refer to documentation string
    for details.
  * enhancement: name of a socket-stream is now "a socket" instead of
    "a constant string".
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now supports lockf(). (Thanks to Zach Beane.)
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now supports getcwd(). (Thanks to Tassilo Horn.)
  * enhancement: SB-INTROSPECT:FUNCTION-ARGLIST shows nicer argument lists
    for generic functions. (Thanks to Tobias C. Rittweiler)
  * optimization: bignum printing speed has been improved by 20-40%
    (depending on the bignum size.)
  * bug fix: WITH-MUTEX and WITH-RECURSIVE-LOCK are now interrupt safe
    on Linux.
  * bug fix: the cache used by the CLOS to store precomputed effective
    methods, slot offsets, and constant return values is now thread and
    interrupt safe.
  * bug fix: generic function dispatch function updating is now thread
    and interrupt safe (in the sense that the known issues have been
    fixed.)
  * bug fix: ADD/REMOVE-METHOD is now thread and interrupt safe.
  * bug fix: interning EQL-specializers is now thread and interrupt safe.
  * bug fix: asdf systems with dependencies to the SB-POSIX or
    SB-BSD-SOCKETS contribs can be loaded with :FORCE T.
  * bug fix: interrupt safety of applicable method computation has been
    improved.

changes in sbcl-1.0.6 relative to sbcl-1.0.5:
  * new contrib: sb-cover, an experimental code coverage tool, is included
    as a contrib module.
  * optimization: STRING-TO-OCTETS for unibyte encodings and UTF-8 is
    significantly faster.
  * optimization: calls of the form (AREF FOO (+ INDEX <constant>)) now
    produce more efficient code on x86-64 if the compiler can determine
    that (+ INDEX <constant>) does not require a bounds check and FOO
    has an element type at least 8 bits wide.
  * enhancement: a new, experimental synchronous timeout facility is
    provided. Refer to SB-SYS:WITH-DEADLINE for details.
  * enhancement: when a symbol name conflict error arises, the
    conflicting symbols are always printed with a package prefix.
    (thanks to Kevin Reid)
  * enhancement: stepping is now once again supported on the SPARC and
    MIPS platforms.  (It is also now more likely to work on CheneyGC
    builds on the PPC.)
  * enhancement: sb-sprof can now also track and report accurate call
    counts.
  * bug fixes: the treatment of non-standard subclasses of
    SB-MOP:SPECIALIZER is more correct.
  * incompatible change: PURIFY no longer copies the data from the
    dynamic space into the static and read-only spaces on platforms
    that use the generational garbage collector
  * bug fix: GETHASH, (SETF GETHASH), CLRHASH and REMHASH are now
    interrupt safe.
  * bug fix: GC race condition occasionally resulting in crashes with
    the error message "SIG_STOP_FOR_GC blocked at a bad place" has been
    fixed.
  * bug fix: &ENVIRONMENT variables in macro lambda lists can now be
    declared ignored.
  * bug fix: DEFSETF lambda lists without &ENVIRONMENT no longer cause
    a STYLE-WARNING to be signalled (regression from 1.0.4.)
  * bug fix: an asynchronous interrupt could previously leave the
    system running with GC inhibited.
  * bug fix: a DECLARE form evaluated at top-level now causes an error
    rather than silently (or verbosely) returning NIL.
  * bug fix: trying to dissassemble functions compiled at high DEBUG could
    result in a error being signalled due to source form lookup errors.
    (reported by Peter Graves)

changes in sbcl-1.0.5 relative to sbcl-1.0.4:
  * incompatible change: removed writer methods for host-ent-name,
    host-ent-addresses -- changing the values did not update the DNS
    information anyway.
  * minor incompatible change: changed experimental JOIN-THREAD interface
  * documentation: the manual now lists reader and writer methods
    in class slot documentation sections. (thanks to Richard M Kreuter)
  * documentation: unwinding from asyncronous events has been
    documented as unsafe.
  * documentation: SB-SYS:WITHOUT-GCING has been documented as unsafe
    in multithreaded application code.
  * optimization: GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME has been optimized on POSIX
    platforms. (thanks to James Anderson for the optimization hint)
  * optimization: REPLACE, SUBSEQ, and COPY-SEQ are now optimized in
    more cases.
  * optimization: STRING-{EQUAL,LESSP,GREATER-P} and their NOT-
    variants no longer cons.
  * optimization: Direct calls to CHAR-{EQUAL,LESSP,GREATERP} and
    their NOT- variants no longer cons.
  * optimization: EQUAL hash tables no longer use SXHASH for objects
    of all data types, but instead use an EQL hash for types for which
    EQUAL is the same as EQL.
  * optimization: the non-inlined generic versions of AREF and (SETF AREF)
    are significantly faster.
  * optimization: new STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM implementation is much
    faster for large outputs and conses 30% less on average.
  * enhancement: XREF information is now collected for references made
    to global variables using SYMBOL-VALUE and a constant argument.
  * enhancement: SIGINT now causes a specific condition
    SB-SYS:INTERACTIVE-INTERRUPT to be signalled.

    been fixed. (reported by James Anderson)
  * bug fix: incorrect ROOM reporting on x86-64 has been fixed.
    (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * bug fix: DEFSETF now allows &ENVIRONMENT and disallows &AUX as
    required by the CLHS. (reported by Samium Gromoff)
  * bug fix: dead unbound variable references now signal an error.
    (reported by Marco Monteiro)
  * bug fix: / with an unused value was being deleted in safe code.
    (thanks to Marco Monteiro and Kevin Reid)
  * bug fix: number of characters that can be written onto a single
    line in a file is unlimited.
  * bug fix: some GC deadlocks caused by asynchronous interrupts have
    been fixed by inhibiting interrupts for when GC is disabled.
  * bug fix: some interrupt safety issues with GETHASH, (SETF
    GETHASH), CLRHASH and REMHASH have been fixed.
  * bug fix: binding *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS* to a value that is not a type
    specifier no longer causes infinite recursion.
  * bug fix: SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS declarations no longer trigger a
    bogus warning in DEFMETHOD bodies. (reported by Kevin Reid)
  * bug fix: an &environment argument with the correct variable information
    is passed to macros that are expanded during byte compilation.
    (reported by Samium Gromoff)
  * bug fix: a logic error was causing the hash function for bignums to
    have excessive amounts of collisions. (reported by Faré Rideau)
  * bug fix: modifying the contents of an array could change the return
    value of SXHASH on that array, which is only allowed for strings
    and bit vectors. (bug introduced in 0.9.16)
  * improvement: the x86-64/darwin port now passes all tests (except
    for the debugger tests) but should still be considered
    experimental until this is fixed.
  * improvement: a style-warning is signaled for CASE (etc) clauses with
    duplicate keys. (thanks to Kevin Reid)
  * improvement: macos/x86 and macos/x86-64 now use mach exception
    handlers for dealing with illegal instructions (for trapping and
    error handling) and memory protection violations (for GC).

changes in sbcl-1.0.4 relative to sbcl-1.0.3:
  * new platform: experimental support for x86-64/darwin (MacOS).
  * incompatible change: the thread-safe (on most platforms) getaddrinfo
    and getnameinfo sockets functions are used instead of gethostbyaddr
    and gethostbyname, on platforms where the newer functions are available.
    As a result, the ALIASES field of HOST-ENT will always be NIL on these
    platforms.
  * change: runtimes with embedded cores (i.e. saved with :EXECUTABLE T)
    don't print the startup banner, but behave as if --noinform was passed
    as a command line argument. (thanks to Kevin Reid)
  * new experimental feature: added JOIN-THREAD (by NIIMI Satoshi)
  * optimization: code using alien values with undeclared types is much faster.
  * optimization: the compiler is now able to open code SEARCH in more cases.
  * optimization: more compact typechecks on x86-64 (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * bug fix: using standardized COMMON-LISP special variables as loop
    variables no longer signals bogus package lock violations. (reported
    by Eric Marsden)
  * bug fix: declaring local loop variables to be of a range-limited type
    such as (SINGLE-FLOAT 1.0 2.0) no longer causes a compile-time error.
    (reported by Andras Simon)
  * bug fix: >= and <= gave wrong results when used with NaNs. (Some NaN
    bugs remain on x86-64.)
  * bug fix: the #= and ## reader macros now interact reasonably with
    funcallable instances.
  * bug fix: type-checks for function arguments were compiled using the
    compiler policy settings of the wrong lexical environment (in 1.0.2
    and 1.0.3).
  * bug fix: SHADOW accepts characters as string designators, as required
    by the spec (thanks to Eric Marsden)
  * bug fix: fixed GC safety issues when foreign functions are called with
    non-base strings as arguments
  * bug fix: more consistent error output for fatal-compiler-warnings, like
    reader errors
  * bug fix: functions with proper names were showing up as NIL in
    backtraces (reported by Edi Weitz, regression in 1.0.2)

changes in sbcl-1.0.3 relative to sbcl-1.0.2:
  * new platform: NetBSD/PPC.  (thanks to Aymeric Vincent)
  * optimization: calls of the form (AREF FOO (+ INDEX <constant>)) now
    produce more efficient code on the x86 if the compiler can determine
    that (+ INDEX <constant>) does not require a bounds check and FOO
    has an element type at least 8 bits wide.
  * bug fix: references to undefined variables are handled the same way
    in toplevel forms as in the normal compiler
  * bug fix: the build scripts again work with non-bash /bin/sh (thanks
    to Magnus Henoch)
  * bug fix: use "gtar" as the asdf-install *TAR-PROGRAM* on NetBSD
    (thanks to Jon Buller)
  * improvement: faster compilation times for complex functions
  * improvement: added readlink support to SB-POSIX (thanks to Richard
    M Kreuter)

changes in sbcl-1.0.2 relative to sbcl-1.0.1:
  * improvement: experimental support for mach exception handling on
    x86/macos. requires building with :MACH-EXCEPTION-HANDLER feature
    to use.

    (thanks to Chun Tian (binghe))
  * improvement: the debugger now displays variables that have been closed
    over, in code compiled with (DEBUG 2) or higher
  * improvement: support for executable cores on NetBSD (thanks to
    Richard Kreuter)
  * new feature: added a RESTART-FRAME debugger command

    be used to provide an implementation for FILE-POSITION on Gray streams
    (thanks to Eric Marsden)

    (thanks to Richard Kreuter)
  * optimization: the function call overhead in code compiled with
    a high DEBUG optimization setting is significantly
  * bug fix: an error is signaled for attempts to use READ-SEQUENCE
    for a (SIGNED-BYTE 8) stream and (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) vector, or vice versa.

  * bug fix: an error is signaled for tagbodies with duplicate tags
    (thanks to Stephen Wilson)
  * bug fix: NIL can be used as a tagbody tag (thanks to Stephen Wilson)
  * bug fix: Win32 port can now handle foreign code unwinding Lisp
    stack frames from alien callbacks.

  * bug fix: SBCL works on Linux/ppc systems with a kernel configured to use
    65k pages (thanks to David Woodhouse)
  * bug fix: fix SB-POSIX dirent and socket on NetBSD (thanks to Richard Kreuter)

changes in sbcl-1.0.1 relative to sbcl-1.0:
  * new platform: FreeBSD/x86-64, including support for threading.
  * new feature: the compiler stores cross-referencing information
    about function calls (who-calls), macroexpansion (who-macroexpands)
    and special variables (who-binds, who-sets, who-references) for code
    compiled with (< SPACE 3). This information is available through the
    sb-introspect contrib.
  * new feature: users may subclass SEQUENCE, and have instances of
    these classes interoperate with standard Common Lisp functions if
    a number of methods are defined.  (This feature is experimental
    and the interface subject to change based on feedback from SBCL
    users and the general community)
  * improvement: sb-sprof traces call stacks to an arbitrary depth on
    x86/x86-64, rather than the previous fixed depth of 8
  * improvement: another pthread back-end of mutex "pthread-futex".
  * bug fix: non-ascii command-line arguments are processed correctly
    (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
  * bug fix: non-required arguments were not passed correctly when a method
    defined using DEFMETHOD was called from a mop-generated method using
    CALL-NEXT-METHOD (reported by Pascal Costanza)
  * bug fix: recursion is now permitted in accessors through
    SLOT-UNBOUND.  (reported by Pascal Costanza)
  * bug fix: an error was signaled at startup if the HOME environment
    variable was defined, but had an empty value (reported by Peter Van Eynde)
  * bug fix: non ordinary lambda-list keyword in ordinary lambda lists
    signal a PROGRAM-ERROR, not a BUG.
  * bug fix: SB-POSIX:READDIR works when built with large file support.
  * bug fix: ENOUGH-NAMESTRING works relative to #p"/" as well. (thanks
    to Marco Monteiro)
  * enhancement: DESTRUCTURING-BIND lambda-list uses &BODY instead of &REST
    for better automatic indentation support. (thanks to Matt Pillsbury)
  * optimization: loading generic functions no longer takes O(n^2) time,
    proportional to the amount of methods in the generic function
    (reported by Todd Sabin and Jeremy Brown)
  * optimization: the FIND and POSITION family of sequence functions
    are significantly faster on arrays whose element types have been
    declared.
  * improvements to the Windows port:
    ** Intermittent heap corruption problems have been fixed. (thanks
       to Alastair Bridgewater)
    ** TRACE :ENCAPSULATE NIL (and function end breakpoints)
       work on Windows.
    ** Lisp is able to unwind foreign exception frames from alien
       callbacks. (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)

changes in sbcl-1.0 relative to sbcl-0.9.18:
  * improvement: experimental support for threading on FreeBSD/x86.
    (thanks to NIIMI Satoshi)
  * improvement: runtime option --dynamic-space-size can be used
    to set the size of the dynamic space reserved on startup.
  * improvement: floating point modes in effect are now saved in
    core, and restored on startup.
  * improvement: GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME now reports the time since
    startup, not time since first call to GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME.
  * improvement: SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE explicitly checks that multiple
    threads are not running after *SAVE-HOOKS* have run.
  * improvement: writes to CLOS instance slots are type-checked in code
    compiled with (SAFETY 3)
  * improvement: floating-point exception handling on FreeBSD (thanks to
    NIIMI Satoshi)
  * improvement: SB-POSIX supports time(2), utime(2) and utimes(2)
    (thanks to Zach Beane)
  * improvement: support for files larger than 2GB for CL streams and SB-POSIX
    on Linux/x86
  * improvement: added support for the Shift-JIS external format.
    (contributed by NIIMI Satoshi)
  * improvement: callbacks are supported on Linux/PPC.  (thanks to
    Joshua Ross)
  * bug fix: compiler bug triggered by a (non-standard) VALUES
    declaration in a LET* was fixed. (reported by Kaersten Poeck)
  * bug fix: file compiler no longer confuses validated and already
    dumped structurres. (reported by Kaersten Poeck)
  * bug fix: ADJUST-ARRAY :FILL-POINTER T on an array without a
    fill-pointer signals a type-error as required. (thanks to
    Lars Brinkhoff)
  * bug fix: disassemly of funcallable instances works.
  * bug fix: single stepping on PPC.
  * bug fix: fix thread-safety problems in the type system (generally
    manifesting as nonsensical errors like "STRING is a bad type specifier
    for sequences" or "The value 1 is not of type FIXNUM")
  * bug fix: version components are handled correctly in TRANSLATE-PATHNAME
    (reported by Josip Gracin)
  * bug fix: an error is signaled for attempts to displace arrays with
    incompatible element types (thanks to Mario Mommer)
  * bug fix: more correct handling of wide characters in debug info
    (bug reported by Attila Lendvai and fixed by Juho Snellman)
  * optimization: method calls with &OPTIONAL or &KEY arguments are faster
    and don't cause extra consing
  * optimization: MAP and MAP-INTO are significantly faster on vectors
    whose elements types have been declared.
  * Improvements to SB-SPROF:
    ** Support for allocation profiling
    ** Reduced profiling overhead, especially for long profiling runs

    ** DIRECTORY now works correctly with :WILD-INFERIORS.
    ** DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME works on times before 00:00:00 January
       1st 1970 (although time timezone data will be unreliable).
    ** Hyperbolic functions TANH, ASINH, ACOSH, and ATANH work.

changes in sbcl-0.9.18 (1.0.beta?) relative to sbcl-0.9.17:
  * enhancement: SB-POSIX now supports cfsetispeed(3), cfsetospeed(3),
    cfgetispeed(3), cfgetospeed(3), and related constants. (thanks to
    Max-Gerd Retzlaff)
  * bug fix: two potential GC deadlocks affecting threaded builds.
  * bug fix: (TYPEP #\A '(NOT (MEMBER #\" #\{ #\:))) now correctly
    returns T (reported by Anton Kazennikov)
  * bug fix: the STORE-VALUE restart of CHECK-TYPE works correctly
    with non-variable places
  * bug fix: remove a race condition in the setting of
    funcallable-instance functions, this should make threaded CLOS
    code more stable against memory faults.
  * bug fix: corruption of specials when unbinding is interrupted by an
    asynchronous unwind (reported by Hannu Koivisto)
  * improvement: the debugger will now also display local variables that
    are only used once, for code compiled with a DEBUG optimization quality
    of 2 or higher.

changes in sbcl-0.9.17 (0.9.99?) relative to sbcl-0.9.16:
  * feature: weak hash tables, see MAKE-HASH-TABLE documentation
  * incompatible change: External-format support for FFI calls.  The
    SB-ALIEN:C-STRING no longer implies an ASCII
    external-format. Instead the string is subject to external-format
    conversion. Additionally return values of type SB-ALIEN:C-STRING
    are by default of type (SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER), not
    SIMPLE-BASE-STRING. For an alien type that behaves like the old
    SB-ALIEN:C-STRING type, use (SB-ALIEN:C-STRING :EXTERNAL-FORMAT
    :ASCII :ELEMENT-TYPE BASE-CHAR).  (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
  * incompatible change: SB-EXT package no longer contains the
    following unused symbols: *GC-NOTIFY-AFTER*, *GC-NOTIFY-BEFORE*,
    *GC-NOTIFY-STREAM*, *ERROR-PRINT-LENGTH*, *ERROR-PRINT-LEVEL*,
    *ERROR-PRINT-LINES*
  * incompatible change: the single-stepper is no longer available
    on Alpha, Mips and Sparc platforms.
  * minor incompatible change: the direct superclasses of
    SB-MOP:FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-OBJECT are (FUNCTION STANDARD-OBJECT),
    not (STANDARD-OBJECT FUNCTION).  This makes the
    class-precedence-lists of GENERIC-FUNCTION and
    STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION comply with the requirement of ANSI
    1.4.4.5.
  * minor incompatible change: the default stream external format on
    non-unicode SBCL is no longer detected from the locale, but is always
    ISO-8859-1
  * new feature: Add a version of evaluator that uses an interpreter instead
    of the compiler. EVAL still uses the compiler by default, to switch it
    to use the interpreter, set the value of the variable
    SB-EXT:*EVALUATOR-MODE* to :INTERPRET.
  * minor incompatible change: the single-stepper REPL has been merged
    with the normal debugger (see the "Stepping" heading of the debugger help
    for more details). The debugger command STEP will no longer switch
    to the single-stepper REPL.
  * bug fix: ENOUGH-NAMESTRING on pathnames with no name and a pattern
    for a type now works.
  * bug fix: loading of default sysinit file works. (thanks to Leonid
    Slobodov)
  * bug fix: better detection of circularities in the file-compiler.
    (reported by Marco Monteiro)
  * bug fix: the CL pathname functions now work with files that have
    non-ASCII characters in their names (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
  * bug fix: The :PTY argument for RUN-PROGRAM will now work on
    systems with Unix98 pty semantics.
  * bug fix: ASDF-INSTALL will now work with bsd tar.
  * bug fix: ASDF-INSTALL uses GNU tar on Solaris (thanks to Josip
    Gracin).
  * bug fix: timers expiring in dead threads no longer cause a
    type-error (reported by Paul "Nonny Mouse").
  * bug fix: thanks to more lightweight single-stepper instrumentation,
    code compiled with (DEBUG 3) will compile and execute significantly faster,
    and will have more accurate type-inferencing than before
  * bug fix: SLOT-VALUE optimizations are no longer done on method parameters
    whose bindings are modified
  * improvements to the win32 port (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk):
    ** bug fix: arguments to RUN-PROGRAM are escaped correctly
    ** replace dummy implementations of CL:MACHINE-INSTANCE and
       CL:SOFTWARE-VERSION with proper version

changes in sbcl-0.9.16 relative to sbcl-0.9.15:
  * feature: implemented the READER-METHOD-CLASS and
    WRITER-METHOD-CLASS portion of the Class Initialization Protocol
    as specified by AMOP.
  * incompatible change: variable SB-EXT:*USE-IMPLEMENTATION-TYPES*
    no longer exists.
  * optimization: faster LOGCOUNT implementation on x86 and x86-64
    (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * optimization: hashing of general arrays and vectors has been
    improved. (reported by Any Fingerhut)
  * enhancement: SB-INTROSPECT is now able to find definitions of
    profiled functions. (thanks to Troels Henriksen)
  * enhancement: compiler-macro expansion applies now to FUNCALL forms
    as well, allowing compiler-macros for SETF-functions to expand.
  * enhancement: step-instrumentation no longer wraps known
    single-value functions with multiple-value context, allowing
    better type inference.
  * fixed bug #337: use of MAKE-METHOD in method combination now works
    even in the presence of user-defined method classes.  (reported by
    Bruno Haible and Pascal Costanza)
  * fixed bug #339(c): if there are applicable methods not part of any
    long-form method-combination group, call INVALID-METHOD-ERROR.
    (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug #361: the :FUNCTION initarg in the protocol for
    initialization of methods can now be used to override
    internally-produced optimized functions.  (reported by Bruno
    Haible)
  * bug fix: extensions of MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA which wrap the
    system-provided lambda expression no longer cause warnings about
    unbound #:|pv-table| symbols.
  * bug fix: improved the handling of type declarations and the
    detection of violations for keyword arguments with non-constant
    defaults.
  * bug fix: potentially erronous calls to PATHNAME and
    MERGE-PATHNAMES were being flushed in some cases.
    (reported by Richard Kreuter)
  * bug fix: compiled calls to TYPEP were mishandling obsolete
    instances.  (reported by James Bielman and Attila Lendvai)
  * bug fix: format strings with ~> without matching ~< no longer
    trigger an AVER, but signal an understandable error instead.
    (reported by Antonio Martinez)
  * bug fix: specifying an output-file without a pathname-type for
    COMPILE-FILE or COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME resulted in using the type
    of input-file instead of "fasl". (reported by Robert Dodier)
  * bug fix: compiler-macro lambda-list parsing of FUNCALL forms.
    (reported by James Y Knight).
  * bug fix: compiler-macros-function did not consider the environment
    argument for shadowing by local functions.
  * bug fix: compiler-macros expansion was inhibited by local INLINE
    declarations.
  * bug fix: inline expansions of known functions were subject to
    step-instrumentation in high debug policies, leading to problems
    with type-inference.
  * bug fix: compiler failed to differentiate between different CONS
    types in some cases.
  * bug fix: fixed input, output and error redirection in RUN-PROGRAM
    for win32. (thanks to Mike Thomas and Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
  * bug fix: #368: incorrect use of expressed vs. upgraded array
    element type.
  * bug fix: #306a: more precise unions of array types.
  * thread-safety improvements:
    ** CONDITION-WAIT could return early on Linux, if the thread was
       interrupted and subsequently continued with SIGCONT.
    ** STABLE-SORT and ADJUST-ARRAY were not reentrant.

changes in sbcl-0.9.15 relative to sbcl-0.9.14:
  * added support for the ucs-2 external format.  (contributed by Ivan
    Boldyrev)
  * minor incompatible change: pretty printing of objects of type
    (cons symbol) is, in the default pprint-dispatch-table, now
    sensitive to whether the symbol satisfies FBOUNDP.  (thanks to
    Marcus Pearce)
  * minor incompatible change: SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is now
    called later in a class's lifetime, possibly as late as when the
    first instance of the class is created.  Previously,
    SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE was called by the system as soon as a
    class became finalizeable.
  * fixed bug: FILE-POSITION sometimes returned inconsistent results
    for multibyte external-format streams.  (thanks to "vbzoli")
  * fixed bug: CHANGE-CLASS would fail to preserve the values of slots
    with :ALLOCATION :CLASS inherited from superclasses of the
    original class.
  * fixed bug: anonymous classes can now be created using the :NAME
    initarg and MAKE-INSTANCE / REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE, as specified by
    AMOP.  (reported by Leonid Slobodov on comp.lang.lisp)
  * fixed bug: core-files saved with :EXECUTABLE T can again be
    executed when SBCL_HOME isn't set. (reported by James Knight)
  * fixed bug: toplevel LOCALLY forms with declarations could
    occasionally get miscompiled. (reported by Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
  * fixed bug: printing from several different threads using different
    values of *print-case* could cause invalid output, due to
    some internal special variables of the printer not being bound
    thread-locally (reported by Max Mikhanosha)
  * fixed bug: SPECIALIZER metaobjects (including anonymous classes
    and EQL-SPECIALIZERs) can be used as specializers to DEFMETHOD.
    (reported by Pascal Costanza)
  * fixed bug: FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is called from
    REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE on classes when the class has previously
    been finalized, as required by AMOP.
  * minor code generation optimizations:
    ** better register allocation in CLOS dispatching functions
    ** overflow detection when coercing signed bytes to fixnums on x86-64
    ** is now implemented with one IMUL instruction instead of three shifts
    ** more efficient bit-vector access on x86 and x86-64
    ** more efficient access to raw structure slots on x86 and x86-64
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST.8: ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST must
       return its argument.

changes in sbcl-0.9.14 relative to sbcl-0.9.13:
  * feature: thread support on Solaris/x86, and experimental thread support
    on OS X/x86.
  * feature: SBCL now tries to signal a STORAGE-CONDITION when running out
    of heap.
  * feature: SBCL now provides USE-VALUE and STORE-VALUE restarts in the
    default method for SLOT-UNBOUND.
  * minor incompatible change: prevent the user from specializing the
    new-value argument to SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS.  It's
    somewhat counter to the intent of the protocol, I (CSR) think, and
    additionally it just doesn't work in SBCL as currently
    implemented, thanks to optimizations (that are always valid for
    the other three SLOT-VALUEish functions, but not for the setter).
  * minor incompatible change: the :SB-LDB feature is now enabled by
    default, and DISABLE-DEBUGGER and ENABLE-DEBUGGER also affect
    the low-level debugger.
  * enchancement: RUN-PROGRAM is now able to extract the file-descriptor
    from SYNONYM-STREAM and TWO-WAY-STREAM provided they can be decomposed
    down to an SB-SYS:FD-STREAM, allowing direct communication in
    more cases. Temporary files and pipes are still used as a fallback
    strategy.
  * thread-safety: DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME & GET-DECODED-TIME depended
    on the non-reentrant C functions localtime(3) and gmtime(3).
  * bug fix: global optimization policy was not visible in LOCALLY and
    MACROLET forms.
  * bug fix: class objects can be used as specializers in methods.
    (reported by Pascal Costanza)
  * bug fix: native unparsing of pathnames with :DIRECTORY NIL failed
    with a type error. (reported by blitz_ on #lisp)
  * bug fix: unparsing logical pathnames with :NAME :WILD :TYPE NIL
    failed with a type error.  (reported by Pascal Bourguignon)
  * bug fix: merging pathnames against defaults with :DIRECTORY
    starting with '(:RELATIVE :BACK) should preserve the :BACK.
    (reported by James Y Knight)
  * bug fix: saving large (>2GB) cores on x86-64 now works
  * bug fix: a x86-64 backend bug when compiling (setf aref) with a
    constant index and a (simple-array (signed-byte 32)) array
  * bug fix: NAME-CHAR on an invalid symbol no longer signals an
    error (patch by Robert J. Macomber)
  * feature: TIME now displays the amount of run-time spent in GC
  * bug fix: The debugger now does a better job of respecting
    (PUSH '(*PRINT-CIRCLE* . T) SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST*)
    when printing SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-CONDITION*. (This is a debugger-only
    workaround for bug 403.)
  * bug fix: floating point exception handling now works on FreeBSD
    (thanks to NIIMI Satoshi)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** MISC.641: LET-conversion were not supposed to work in late
       compilation stages.
  * improvements to the Win32/x86 port:
    ** GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME implemented, thanks to Frank Buss.
    ** improved SB-BSD-SOCKETS support, thanks to Timothy Ritchey.

changes in sbcl-0.9.13 relative to sbcl-0.9.12:
  * new feature: source path information is generated for macro-expansion
    errors for use in IDE's like Slime (thanks to Helmut Eller)
  * bug fix: calls to the compiler no longer modify *RANDOM-STATE*
  * bug fix: compiler does not loop forever on an invalid type in
    TYPEP.
  * improvement: compilation of most CLOS applications is significantly
    faster
  * optimization: added a limited bytecode compiler for simple toplevel
    forms, speeding up compilation and FASL loading
  * bug fix: the statistical profiler now properly distinguishes anonymous
    functions

changes in sbcl-0.9.12 relative to sbcl-0.9.11:
  * minor incompatible change: in sbcl-0.9.11 (but not earlier
    versions) SB-MOP:FINALIZE-INHERITANCE would recursively descend
    into subclasses of the finalized class.  Now user calls to
    FINALIZE-INHERITANCE finalize just the one class, and calls by the
    system return before any subclasses are finalized.
  * minor incompatible change: The reader no longer ignores errors
    regarding non-existent packages in #+ and #- feature tests.
  * new feature: command line options --no-sysinit, --no-userinit to
    inhibit loading the corresponding init files
  * new feature: add a generic function SOCKET-SEND to SB-BSD-SOCKETS,
    for sending data through UDP sockets (thanks to François-René Rideau)
  * minor incompatible change: SIGPIPE is ignored and "Broken pipe"
    error is signalled instead (thanks to François-René Rideau)
  * minor incompatible change: Error signalling behaviour of lexical
    operations violating package locks has changed slightly. Refer to
    documentation on package locks for details.
  * enhancement: EVAL can process IF-expressions without resorting to the
    compiler.
  * bug fix: Some operations involving SIN, COS, or TAN weren't being
    constant-folded properly due to missing out-of-line functions.
    (reported by Mika Pihlajamäki)
  * bug fix: LISTEN sometimes returned T even in cases where no data was
    immediately available from the stream
  * fixed bug: types of the last two arguments to SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR
    were reversed. (reported by Levente Mészáros)
  * fixed bug: Tests for the (VECTOR T) type gave the wrong answer
    when given a vector displaced to an adjustable array.  (reported
    by Utz-Uwe Haus)
  * bug fix: derivation of float boundaries from numbers outside the
    appropriate float range (reported by John Wiseman)
  * bug fix: MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS accepts en empty slot name
    list.
  * bug fix: precomputing cache entries for generic functions with
    some subclasses of specializers as yet invalid does not attempt to
    fill a cache line with a negative offset.  (reported by Levente
    Mészároz)
  * improvements to DOCUMENTATION for TYPE and STRUCTURE doc-types:
    allow condition class objects as arguments to DOCUMENTATION and
    (SETF DOCUMENTATION); only find and set documentation for
    structure names for the STRUCTURE doc-type.  (suggested by Gary
    King)
  * improvements to the Win32/x86 port:
    ** (user-homedir-pathname) and default initialization file
       locations now know about the user's "Documents and Settings"
       directory (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk)
    ** run-program is implemented (thanks to Mike Thomas)
    ** sockets support (thanks to Timothy Ritchey)
    ** better backtrace support (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)
    ** sb-grovel supported
    ** asdf-install and sb-posix work somewhat
    ** capable of running Slime using SWANK:*COMMUNICATION-STYLE* NIL
  * improvements to the Solaris/x86 port:
    ** works on Solaris 11/Solaris Express
    ** floating-point exception handling support
    ** support for the breakpoint-based TRACE :ENCAPSULATE NIL facility
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** REMOVE-METHOD returns its generic function argument even when
       the method is not one of the generic functions' methods.
    ** objects declared as MEMBER types can be admissible arguments to
       structure accessors.
    ** printing characters should simply be printed by the FORMAT ~:C
       directive.
    ** compiler failure when compiling functions with hairy constant
       defaults for optional parameters.
    ** compiler produces wrong code when MAYBE-INLINE-expanding a
       function, which is already optimized.

changes in sbcl-0.9.11 relative to sbcl-0.9.10:
  * new platform: experimental support for SBCL x86/Darwin, including
    MacOS X 10.4.5 on Intel.
  * new feature: Unicode character names are now known to the system
    (through CHAR-NAME and NAME-CHAR).
  * new feature: the filesystem location of SBCL's core file is
    exposed to lisp through the variable SB-EXT:*CORE-PATHNAME*.
  * minor incompatible change: the contrib modules SB-POSIX and
    SB-BSD-SOCKETS no longer depend on stub C libraries; the intent of
    this change is to make it easier to distribute
    location-independent binaries.
  * bug fix: as implied by AMOP, standardized classes no longer have
    slots named by external symbols of public packages.  (reported by
    Pascal Costanza)
  * optimization: calling functions via constant symbols -- as in
    (FUNCALL 'FOO) -- is now roughly as efficient as calling them
    via the function object as in (FUNCALL #'FOO).
  * optimization: on x86 and x86-64, the calling convention for the
    case of dealing with an unknown number of values has been altered
    to be friendlier to the prediction heuristics implemented,
    particularly with reference to CALL and RET pairing.  (thanks to
    Alastair Bridgewater)
  * optimization: on x86, the code for access to thread-local symbol
    values and binding/unbinding of thread-local symbols is smaller.
    (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)
  * enhancement: CONSTANTP is now able to determine constantness of
    more complex forms, including calls to constant-foldable standardized
    functions and some special forms beyond QUOTE.
  * fixed bug: occasional GC crashes on Solaris/x86
  * optimization: x86-64 supports stack allocation of results of simple
    calls of MAKE-ARRAY, bound to variables, declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT
  * enchancement: the PROCESS-INPUT and -OUTPUT streams created by
    SB-EXT:RUN-PROGRAM can be used for both character and byte IO
    (thanks to James Knight)
  * fixed bug: CL:LISTEN always returns NIL at end of file, as required
    by the standard (thanks to Stephen Compall)

changes in sbcl-0.9.10 relative to sbcl-0.9.9:
  * new feature: new SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE keyword argument :EXECUTABLE can
    be used for bundling the runtime and the core file into one
    executable binary. This feature is not currently supported on all SBCL
    platforms.  (thanks to James Bielman and NIIMI Satoshi)
  * new feature: a generational or ephemeral garbage collector is now
    the default on the PowerPC platform (both Linux and Darwin).  The
    old Cheney (stop and copy) collector is a build-time option.
    (thanks to Cyrus Harmon, after Raymond Toy)
  * minor incompatible change: the method by which SBCL finds its
    contributed modules has changed; it no longer relies on symbolic
    links from an $SBCL_HOME/systems directory, but searches directly
    in the subdirectories of $SBCL_HOME.
  * enhancement: the dynamic heap size on the Linux/PPC platform is
    markedly larger, even using the older Cheney garbage collector.
  * fixed bug #399: full call to DATA-VECTOR-REF in accesses to
    certain complicated string types.  (reported by Gary King)
  * fixed bug: STRING-TO-OCTETS and OCTETS-TO-STRING did not convert
    character codes.  (thanks to Yaroslav Kavenchuk and Ivan Boldyrev)
  * fixed bug: DOCUMENTATION on structures no longer signals an
    error if no structure type of the right name exists.  (reported by
    Glenn Ehrlich)
  * fixed bug: compiled calls to MAKE-INSTANCE where there is an
    applicable non-standard primary or :AROUND method on
    INITIALIZE-INSTANCE or SHARED-INITIALIZE and a non-keyword initarg
    no longer cause unbound variable errors.  (reported by Kevin Reid)
  * fixed bug: metacircle resolution in cases where methods have slots
    added before the slots from STANDARD-METHOD.  (reported by Jean
    Bresson)
  * fixed bug: the Power PC assembly code for calling into lisp
    sometimes computed its return address wrongly (depending on the
    15th bit of the address, fixed at link time).  This used to
    manifest itself in a segmentation violation while building PCL.
    (reported by Kevin Rosenberg, Eric Marsden, Lars Brinkhoff and
    many others over the years)
  * fixed bug: ROOM no longer reports silly numbers for stack usage if
    the stack pointer (treated as a signed integer) is negative.
    (thanks to Peter van Eynde)

changes in sbcl-0.9.9 relative to sbcl-0.9.8:
  * new platform: experimental support for the Windows operating
    system has been added.  (thanks to Alastair Bridgewater)

    (reported by Andrej Grozin and Hendrik Maryns)
  * optimization: major improvements to GC efficiency on GENCGC platforms
  * optimization: faster implementation of EQUAL

  * fixed segfaults on x86 FreeBSD 7-current.  (thanks to NIIMI Satoshi)

changes in sbcl-0.9.8 relative to sbcl-0.9.7:
  * minor incompatible change: (SETF CLASS-NAME) and (SETF
    GENERIC-FUNCTION-NAME) are generic functions once more (reverting
    the change in the 0.9.7 release).  (SETF CLASS-NAME) is specified
    by ANSI as a generic function, and for consistency (SETF
    GENERIC-FUNCTION-NAME) is treated likewise.
  * fixed bug #233.b: make constraint propagation notice when a variable
    value is changed after it is referenced but before it is used
  * fixed bug #296: no more arbitrary behaviour from filenames with
    odd characters as --load arguments.  (reported by Adam Warner)
  * fixed bug #390: :CHARACTER-SET pathname components now work as
    expected.  (reported by Tim Daly Jr)
  * fixed bug #391: complicated :TYPE intersections in slot
    definitions no longer cause an error in PCL internals.
  * fixed bug #392: plugged a hole in the obsolete-instance protocol.
  * bug fix: FILE-STRING-LENGTH is now external-format sensitive,
    returning the number of octets which would be written to the
    file-stream.  (thanks to Robert J. Macomber)
  * bug fix: the SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS contrib passes external-format
    arguments to the internal stream functions.  (thanks to David
    Lichteblau)
  * bug fix: stack exhaustion is now handled on the x86/SunOS
    platform.  (thanks to Daisuke Homma)

    ** DOCUMENTATION returns NIL instead of "" for method combinations
       that don't have a docstring

changes in sbcl-0.9.7 relative to sbcl-0.9.6:
  * minor incompatible change: (SETF CLASS-NAME) and (SETF
    GENERIC-FUNCTION-NAME) are no longer generic functions, and
    therefore are not customizeable by user code (as seems to be at
    least permitted and maybe required by AMOP).  As a consolation,
    however, the SBCL implementation of these functions now calls
    REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE as specified by AMOP.
  * bug fix: slot-definition documentation is propagated as per ANSI
    7.6.2 to EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITIONS.
    COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION now receives a :DOCUMENTATION
    argument, as do eslotd initialization methods.  (from Pascal
    Costanza's "Closer" project)
  * bug fix: REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE on generic functions calls
    COMPUTE-DISCRIMINATING-FUNCTION (almost) unconditionally, as
    specified by AMOP.
  * bug fix: it is now possible to have more than one subclass of
    STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION without causing stack overflow.
    (reported by Bruno Haible, Pascal Costanza and others)
  * bug fix: the dependent update protocol now works for generic
    functions.  (thanks to Gerd Moellmann; reported by Bruno Haible
    and Pascal Costanza)
  * bug fix: condition-class instances corresponding to
    DEFINE-CONDITION forms are now created eagerly.  (reported by
    Kalle Olavi Niemitalo on comp.lang.lisp)
  * bug fix: floating point printing is more accurate in some
    circumstances.  (thanks to Simon Alexander)
  * bug fix: *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME* now contains the user's pathname
    merged with *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*.
  * bug fix: callbacks on OS X now preserve stack-alignment.
    (thanks to Cyrus Harmon)
  * enhancement: the x86-64 disassembler is much better at
    disassembling SSE instructions.  (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * enhancement: CHECK-TYPE on a variable now allows type-inference
    (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)

    macroexpansion.  (reported by Matthew D Swank on comp.lang.lisp)
  * optimization: non-open coded uses of numeric comparison operators
    (e.g. >) no longer cons when called with more than one parameter
    on platforms supporting dynamic-extent allocation.
  * enhancement: saving cores with foreign code loaded is now supported
    on MIPS/Linux in addition to the previously supported platforms.
  * bug fix: FIND-RESTART now tests for activity, not applicability when given
    a restart object as identifier. (reported by Helmut Eller for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: division by zero in sb-sprof when no samples were collected
  * bug fix: a race when a slow to arrive sigprof signal killed sbcl
  * bug fix: asdf-install uses CRLF as required by the HTTP spec.
    (thanks to Alexander Kjeldaas)
  * new feature: ignoring the return values of destructive functions
    like NREVERSE signals a compile-time style-warning.
    (thanks to Kevin Reid)

    ** SUBTYPEP is slightly more accurate on heinously complicated
       CONS types where some of the members have uncertain (in the
       NIL, NIL sense) type relationships to each other.
  * GENCGC
    ** Cores produced by SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE on GENCGC platforms are
       no longer purified unless :PURIFY T is explicitly specified.
    ** Non-purified cores are significantly smaller than before

changes in sbcl-0.9.5 relative to sbcl-0.9.4:
  * new feature: timers based on Zach Beane's excellent timer package
  * added support for the following external formats: koi8-u,
    x-mac-cyrillic, cp437, cp850, cp852, cp855, cp857, cp860, cp861,
    cp862, cp863, cp864, cp865, cp866, cp869, cp874, iso-8859-2,

    more sigsegvs when receiving a signal to soon
  * optimization: faster 32-bit SB-ROTATE-BYTE:ROTATE-BYTE on non-x86/ppc
    platforms
  * bug fix: add a workaround for the memory randomization features in
    Linux kernels >= 2.6.12 that interfere with SBCL's memory maps. This
    workaround will only be in effect on systems with the proc filesystem
    mounted.
  * bug fix: printing objects of type HASH-TABLE signals a
    PRINT-NOT-READABLE error when *READ-EVAL* is NIL.  (reported by
    Faré Rideau)
  * bug fix: GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME now works even for processes that
    have been running for over 50 days. (reported by Gilbert Baumann)
  * bug fix: the logic for getting names of functions gets less
    confused when confronded with alternate-metaclass
    funcallable-instances.  (reported by Cyrus Harmon)
  * bug fix: FUNCTIONP and (LAMBDA (X) (TYPEP X 'FUNCTION)) are now
    consistent, even on internal alternate-metaclass objects.
  * bug fix: flush closure information collected by physical
    environment analysis prepass before the main pass. (bug reported
    by Vasile Rotaru)

    may be expanded. (reported by Alexander <malishev> on c.l.l)
  * bug fix: no more style-warnings when compiling code using LAST
    under high-SPEED low-SPACE settings.  (reported by David Wallin
    aka froog on #lisp)
  * fixed some incompatibilities between SBCL's MOP and the MOP
    specified by AMOP:
    ** the METAOBJECT class is now implemented;
    ** FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-OBJECT is now a subclass of
       STANDARD-OBJECT, as required;
    ** the classes STANDARD-CLASS and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS are
       now compatible (as required by VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS); there
       remains a consistency requirement over the presence or absence
       of the FUNCTION class in the superclass list of finalized
       classes; see the manual for more details;
    ** the :AROUND method for COMPUTE-SLOTS on
       FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS now honours the primary method's
       requested slot ordering.
  * threads
    ** bug fix: parent thread now can be gc'ed even with a live
       child thread
    ** bug fix: binding a special with PROGV to no value is not
       the same as that symbol not having been bound (thanks to
       Hannu Koivisto)

    characters in the current readtable.  (reported by Nicholas Neuss)
  * bug fix: SUBTYPEP on various CONS types returns more a more

    ** bug fix: gc and INTERRUPT-THREAD don't hang when the RT signal
       queue is full

       derivation were fixed.
    ** SUBTYPEP can now handle types involving the negation of a
       list-form FUNCTION type.

  * increased the maximimum compact environment size to allow
    purify on images with large amounts of functions. (thanks to Cyrus Harmon)
  * partial workaround for bug 135: don't name the function we're
    calling for hairy cases of EVAL, so as not to accumulate one environment
    entry per call to EVAL.  (reported by Kevin Reid)
  * improvements to the x86-64 disassembler. (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * optimization: type testing for non-vector arrays should be faster.
  * fixed TRACE :ENCAPSULATE NIL, added support for :ENCAPSULATE NIL
    on x86-64
  * bug fix: setting 31st element of a bit vector to zero did not work
    on Alpha-32.
  * bug fix: redefining a class definition which failed due to a
    previous accessor / function clash now works (but see BUGS entry
    #380 for more problems in this area).  (thanks to Zach Beane)
  * the long form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION disables method group
    checking when given a single method group with pattern *.  (thanks
    to Wendall Marvel)
  * on x86 compiler supports stack allocation of results of simple
    calls of MAKE-ARRAY, bound to variables, declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT.
  * support for building and running on Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" has been added
    ** Binaries built on Tiger will not run on 10.2 "Jaguar" currently
  * fixed some bugs related to Unicode integration:
    ** the restarts for recovering from input and output encoding
       errors only appear when there is in fact such an error to
       handle.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** MISC.549 and similar: late transformation of unsafe type
       assertions into derived types caused unexpected code
       transformations.
    ** SCALE-FLOAT type deriver is less wrong.
    ** type derivers for EXP, LOG and similar functions compute result
       types for complex arguments better.

    ** EQUAL compiler transform understands specialness of objects
       of type BIT-VECTOR.

       optional.
    ** initialization forms for bindings are not in scope of free special
       declarations.

changes in sbcl-0.8.21 (0.9alpha.1?) relative to sbcl-0.8.20:
  * incompatible change: thread support for non-NPTL systems has
    been removed - locking is buggy and unreliable.  A threaded
    SBCL build will now warn at startup and refuse to create
    new threads, unless futex support is detected in the kernel
  * incompatible change: the top level REPL now has only an ABORT
    restart associated with it, not TOPLEVEL and ABORT as it used to.
    TOP and TOPLEVEL are now available as debugger commands for
    returning to the top level.
  * incompatible change: forms evaluated in the REPL now use the
    global optimization policy.
  * incompatible change: user- and system-initialization files are
    no longer processed with LOAD, but by READ and EVAL; hence the
    global optimization policy, startup package, readtable, etc,
    can be set by them.
  * The .fasl file format number has been incremented because of
    various incompatible changes.
  * internal entry point details and argument counts no longer appear
    in backtraces unless explicitly requested by setting
    SB-DEBUG:*SHOW-ENTRY-POINT-DETAILS*.
  * built-in and standard functions no longer have names like "top
    level local call to FOO".
  * fixed bug 32: functions defined in non-null lexical environments
    now have more legible printed representation
  * fixed bug 33: functions defined in non-null lexical environemnts
    are now more amenable to inspection by INSPECT.
  * workaround for bug 354: XEPs no longer appear in backtraces unless
    explicitly requested.
  * fixed bug: receiving the signal which results from attempting to
    write to mprotect()ed memory (SIGSEGV on Linux and some *BSDs,
    SIGBUS on other *BSDs) on architectures where the C stack is also
    the Lisp stack (x86 and x86-64) from foreign code no longer leads
    to debugger confusion or wild instability.  (reported by Cheuksan
    Wang)
  * fixed bug: COUNT and EQUAL no longer issue compiler efficiency
    notes when operating on objects known to be SIMPLE-BIT-VECTORs.
    (reported by Lutz Euler)
  * fixed bug: (TYPEP X '(MEMBER ...)) no longer returns a list in
    compiled code. (reported by Paul Dietz)
  * fixed bug 276b: mutating with MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ a binding of a
    specialized parameter to a method to something that is not TYPEP
    the specializer is now possible.
  * fixed bug: the MAKE-INSTANCE optimization is now correct in the
    face of package deletion.
  * fixed bug: LOAD should bind *LOAD-PATHNAME* to the merged
    pathname. (reported by David Tolpin on c.l.l)
  * contrib improvement: the SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS contrib now defines
    STRING-SIMPLE-STREAM and FILE-SIMPLE-STREAM as subclasses of
    STRING-STREAM and FILE-STREAM, respectively.
  * contrib improvement: SB-INTROSPECT handles more of SLIME's needs
    than previously; in addition, its test suite is now run on build.
    (thanks to Luke Gorrie)
  * a more robust x86-64 disassembler. (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * optimization: added a immediate representation for single-floats
    on x86-64
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** MISC.564: defined out-of-line version of %ATAN2 on x86.
    ** attempting to create a package with a colliding nickname causes
       correctable errors to be signalled.
    ** MISC.572-574: :START1 and :START2 broken for simple-base-strings.
    ** several x86-64 backend bugs related to sign-extension of immediate
       operands.

changes in sbcl-0.8.20 (0.9alpha.0?) relative to sbcl-0.8.19:
  * fixed inspection of specialized arrays. (thanks to Simon Alexander)
  * fixed disassembly of SHLD and SHRD on x86.  (thanks to David
    Lichteblau)
  * fixed loading of multiply forward-referenced layouts.
    (thanks to Cheuksan Wang)
  * fixed bug 7: less verbose COMPILE-FILE output. Additionally, the
    output is now directed to *STANDARD-OUTPUT* as specified by ANSI.
    (see COMPILE-FILE documentation for details of :PRINT option)
  * fixed bugs 19 and 317: fixed-format floating point printing is
    more accurate.  This also fixes a bug reported by Adam Warner
    related to the ~@F format directive.
  * fixed bug 371: bignum print/read inconsistency. (thanks to Harald
    Hanche-Olsen)
  * fixed bug: SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR correctly shallow-copies a
    dispatch table if the from-char is a dispatch macro character.
  * fixed bug: COUNT and EQUAL on bit vectors with lengths divisible
    by the wordsize no longer ignore the last word.  (reported by Lutz
    Euler)
  * fixed bug in type checking of dynamic-extent variables. (reported
    by Svein Ove Aas)
  * optimization: sequence traversal functions use their freedom to
    coerce function designators to functions.
  * optimization: code with many calls to CLOS methods specialized on
    CLOS classes has had redundant type checks removed.
  * optimization: added declarations to speed up operations that access
    the internal character database (for example STRING-UPCASE)
  * optimization: comparison operations between floats and sufficiently small
    fixnums no longer create extra rationals
  * fixed some bugs related to Unicode integration:
    ** portions of multibyte characters at the end of buffers for
       character-based file input are correctly transferred to the
       start of the buffer at the next read.
    ** COMPILE-FILE now respects any EXTERNAL-FORMAT argument given,
       passing it through to OPEN.
    ** LOAD on source files likewise passes any EXTERNAL-FORMAT
       argument given to internal calls to OPEN.
    ** the built-in comment readers (introduced by character sequences
       ";" and "#|") are more forgiving to encoding errors; they will
       STYLE-WARN and then attempt to resync the stream at a character
       boundary.  (thanks to Teemu Kalvas)
  * fixed some bugs in the x86-64 port:
    ** Negative short int return values from c-calls are sign-extended
       correctly.
    ** The stack is aligned to 16-bytes for c-calls, as required by
       the ABI. (thanks to Cheuksan Wang)
    ** The disassembler understands more x86-64. (thanks to Cheuksan Wang)
    ** The regression tests use SB-ALIEN:INT instead of SB-ALIEN:INTEGER
       for enums. (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
    ** Multiple small optimizations and bugfixes for floating point
       operations.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** Space, Tab, Linefeed, Return and Page have the invalid
       secondary constituent character trait.
    ** SET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR correctly copies multiple-escape character
       syntax.
    ** WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING should only update the index place on
       normal termination.
    ** Pretty-printing backquoted forms when *PRINT-CIRCLE* is true
       works more reliably.
    ** Bit-array operations (BIT-AND and similar) worked incorrectly
       with one-dimensional arrays with fill pointers.
    ** TYPE-OF failed on a complex with an integer realpart and a
       RATIO imagpart.
    ** compiler failure during type inference for the code of form
       (IF (EQL X (THE ...)) ...) (MISC.535).

changes in sbcl-0.8.19 relative to sbcl-0.8.18:
  * new port: SBCL now works in native 64-bit mode on x86-64/Linux
    platform. The port supports 61-bit fixnums, large memory spaces
    and reloading shared object files.
  * enhancement: saving cores with foreign code loaded is now
    supported on ppc/Darwin in addition to the previously supported
    platforms.
  * enhancement: the statistical profiler now walks deeper into the
    call stack for more meaningful call-graphs and accrued time
    reports (x86/x86-64 only). It also now reports time spent in
    foreign functions.
  * enhancement: it is now possible to trace most individual methods
    of a generic function in addition to tracing the generic function
    itself.
  * bug fix: invalid :DEFAULT-INITARGS are detected in compiled calls
    to MAKE-INSTANCE.
  * bug fix: defaulted initargs are passed to INITIALIZE-INSTANCE and
    SHARED-INITIALIZE methods from compiled calls to MAKE-INSTANCE.
  * bug fix: COERCE to (COMPLEX FLOAT) of a complex number no longer
    produces an error.  (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * bug fix: NAMESTRING on pathnames with :WILD components in their
    directories works correctly.  (thanks to Artem V. Andreev)
  * fixed bug 125: compiler preserves identity of closures. (reported
    by Gabe Garza)
  * bug fixed: functions with &REST arguments sometimes failed with
    "Undefined function" when compiled with (DEBUG 3). (reported by
    Robert J. Macomber)
  * bug fix: overflow during compiling of setting element of a bit
    vector with constant index and value. (reported by Timmy Douglas)
  * build fix: fixed the dependence on *LOAD-PATHNAME* and
    *COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME* being absolute pathnames.
  * on x86 compiler partially supports stack allocation of dynamic-extent
    closures.
  * GO and RETURN-FROM do not check the extent of their exit points
    when compiled with SAFETY 0.
  * fixed some bugs related to Unicode integration:
    ** encoding and decoding errors are now much more robustly
       handled; it should now be possible to recover even from invalid
       input or output to the terminal.  (thanks to Teemu Kalvas)
    ** provided a first cut at implementing STRING-TO-OCTETS and
       OCTETS-TO-STRING.  (thanks to Robert J. Macomber)
    ** altered the SB-MD5 contributed module slightly, changing the
       interface just enough for it to be supportable for builds where
       lisp characters are not eight bits.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** the FORMATTER-generated functions for ~V[ conditionals require
       the correct number of arguments.
    ** READ-FROM-STRING returns the mandated second value when applied
       to displaced strings.
    ** the #\Rubout and #\Backspace characters are treated as invalid
       constituent characters by the tokenizer.

changes in sbcl-0.8.18 relative to sbcl-0.8.17:
  * new feature: reloading changed shared object files with
    LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT now causes the new definitions to take effect.
  * new feature: references to foreign variables and functions
    can now be compiled and loaded before the corresponding shared
    object file is loaded, as long as the foreign definitions are
    available at runtime.
  * Solaris 10 (aka SunOS 5.10) on the SPARC platform is now
    supported.  (thanks to Dan Debertin)
  * SB-ALIEN enums can now be represented in Lisp by any symbols, not
    just keywords.  (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * fixed bug #331: structure-class instances corresponding to
    DEFSTRUCT forms are now created eagerly.
  * fixed bug #345: backtraces from calls to undefined functions work
    on x86 as well. Related bug #61 is now also partially fixed on x86
    (backtraces from throws to unknown catch tags.)
  * bug fix: lambda-list parsing is now stricter vrt. order and number
    of lambda-list keywords.
  * bug fix: as specified by AMOP, an error is signalled if a
    class-option appears multiple times in a DEFCLASS form. (reported
    by Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: RANDOM can be compiled when the compiler derives the type
    of its numeric argument as a disjoint set of small integers.
    (reported by Paul Dietz)
  * bug fix: starting a core saved with shared objects loaded when
    those objects are not available no longer causes threaded SBCL to
    hang. (reported by Sean Ross)
  * bug fix: evaluated FUNCTION no longer bypasses encapsulation (eg.
    TRACE).
  * bug fix: (SETF MACRO-FUNCTION) now accepts an optional environment
    argument, which must always be NIL. (reported by Kalle Niemitalo)

    ** RUN-PROGRAM can allow its child to take input from a Lisp
       stream.  (reported by Stefan Scholl)
    ** ASDF-INSTALL successfully downloads .tar.gz files in all
       locales.  (reported by Ken Causey)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** INCF, DECF and REMF evaluate their place form as specified in
       CLtS 5.1.3.
    ** FORMATTER expands ~{ ~} iteration directives with V or #
       parameters correctly.
    ** FORMATTER deals with the ~@[ ~] conditional directive where the
       consequent uses no arguments correctly.
    ** the system has a partial understanding of the (COMPLEX RATIO)
       type specifier.
    ** UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE obeys the lattice upgrading rules
       required.

changes in sbcl-0.8.17 relative to sbcl-0.8.16:
  * new feature: a build-time option (controlled by the :SB-UNICODE
    keyword feature, enabled by default) for building the system with
    support for the entire 21-bit character space defined by the
    Unicode consortium.
  * new feature: the system now has rudimentary external-format
    support; the primary user-visible change at this time is that
    characters with the high bit set (such as lower-case-e-acute) will
    print correctly to a terminal in a UTF-8 environment.
  * minor incompatible change: BASE-CHAR no longer names a class;
    however, CHARACTER continues to do so, as required by ANSI.
  * minor incompatible change: SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-PRINT-FOO* variables
    are no longer supported, and SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST*
    has been moved to the SB-EXT package (temporarily re-exported from
    SB-DEBUG).
  * minor incompatible change: SB-C::*COMPILER-ERROR-PRINT-FOO* variables
    are no longer supported: use SB-EXT:*COMPILER-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST*
    instead.
  * fixed bug #351: better error-handlind and reporting for malformed
    LET and LET* forms.
  * fixed bug #350: bignum-printing is now more memory-efficient,
    allowing printing of very large bignums, eg. (expt 2 10000000).
    (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug #302: better primitive-type selection for intersection
    types.
  * fixed bug #308: non-graphic characters now all have names, as
    required.  (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: redefining a class with different superclasses now correctly
    removes it from the direct-subclasses of its previous superclasses.
    (reported by David Morse)
  * bug fix: (SETF FIND-CLASS) using a FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASS as the
    new value now works. (reported by Bruno Haible)

    options in DEFCLASS as per AMOP 5.4.2. (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: SB-MOP:CLASS-PROTOTYPE now signals an error if the class
    is not yet finalized, as required by AMOP. (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: SB-MOP:ALLOCATE-INSTANCE method for instances of BUILT-IN-CLASS
    now exists, an signals an error.

    during macroexpansion for non-iteration variables as well. (reported
    by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)

  * bug fix: Default value of EOF-ERROR-P in READ-FROM-STRING is true.
    (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: ERROR now signals a TYPE-ERROR if the arguments to ERROR
    do not designate a condition.  (reported by Bruno Haible for
    CMUCL)
  * bug fix: UNINTERN, USE-PACKAGE, IMPORT and EXPORT all signal an
    SB-EXT:NAME-CONFLICT condition (subtype of PACKAGE-ERROR) in the
    name conflict situations in CLHS 11.1.1.2.5, and provide a restart
    permitting resolution in favour of any of the conflicting symbols.
    (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: EQUAL compiler optimizations is less aggressive on
    strings which can potentially compare true despite having distinct
    specialized array element types.
  * bug fix: unit enumerations can be defined without dividing by
    zero.  (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * FORMAT compile-time argument count checking has been enhanced.
    (report from Bruno Haible for CMUCL)
  * a partial workaround for the bug 262: the compiler does not try to
    inline-expand a local function doing RETURN-FROM from a deleted
    BLOCK. (thanks to Peter Denno for the bug report and to David
    Wragg for the simple test case)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** RENAME-PACKAGE allows all package designators as new package
       names.
    ** constraint propagation and lambda variable substitution are
       more cautious in dealing with partially deleted code.
    ** compiler sometimes lost reoptimization passes.
    ** CERROR, given a condition as condition designator, passes its
       remaining arguments to the continue format control without
       complaint.
    ** Case-altering FORMAT directives work correctly on non-ASCII
       characters.
    ** The REAL type specifier handles bounds outside the floating
       point ranges without signalling FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW.
    ** Functions with IR1-transformations can create intercomponent
       references to global functions.
    ** NIL parameter to the FORMAT directive ~^ means `unsupplied
       parameter'.
    ** FORMAT ~R treats a nil value for its first parameter correctly.

changes in sbcl-0.8.16 relative to sbcl-0.8.15:
  * enhancement: saving cores with foreign code loaded is now
    supported on x86/NetBSD and sparc/Linux in addition to the previously
    supported platforms.

    copies of HTML documentation to be installed -- should not happen
    any more. (reported by Stefan Scholl)
  * bug fix: parsing self-recursive alien record types multiple times
    no longer causes infinite recursion. (reported by Thomas F. Burdick,
    original patch by Helmut Eller for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: stack-exhaustion detection works now on NetBSD as well.
    (thanks to Richard Kreuter)

    generic functions in other (locked) packages no longer signals
    bogus package lock violations. (reported by François-René Rideau)

    associated bogus type declarations. (reported by David Wragg and
    Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: read-write consistency on streams of element-type
    (SIGNED-BYTE N) for N > 32.  (reported by Bruno Haible for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: redefiniton of the only method of a generic function with

    redefinition of generic functions with no DEFGENERIC to an
    incompatible lambda list now signals an error.  (thanks to Zach
    Beane)
  * bug fix: DEFGENERIC now works even when there's a function of the
    same name in an enclosing lexical environment.  (thanks to Zach
    Beane)

    IR1-optimization.  (Debian bug report #273606 by Gabor Melis)
  * optimization: added loop analysis and improved register allocation
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** POSITION on displaced vectors with non-zero displacement
       returns the right answer.
    ** (SIMPLE-STRING) is a valid type specifier for sequence
       creators.
    ** *PRINT-LEVEL* handling for slotless structures is pedantically
       correct.
    ** PPRINT-INDENT accepts a request for an indentation of any REAL.
    ** PPRINT-TAB (and the FORMAT ~T directive) now indent by the
       correct amounts.
    ** The justification version of the FORMAT ~< directive treats
       non-zero minpad parameter correctly.

changes in sbcl-0.8.15 relative to sbcl-0.8.14:
  * incompatible change: SB-INT:*BEFORE-SAVE-INITIALIZATIONS* and
    SB-INT:*AFTER-SAVE-INITIALIZATIONS* have been renamed
    SB-EXT:*SAVE-HOOKS* and SB-EXT:*INIT-HOOKS*, and are now part of
    the supported interface.

    Timothy Moore's work for CMUCL)
  * bug fix: DEFTYPE lambda-list parsing now binds unsupplied keyword
    parameters to * instead of NIL if no initform is supplied.
    (reported by Johan Bockgaard)
  * bug fix: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO lambda-list parsing now binds
    correctly when FUNCALL appears as the car of the form. Note:
    despite this FUNCALL forms are not currently subject to
    compiler-macro expansion. (port of Raymond Toy's fix for the
    same from CMUCL, reported by Johan Bockgaard)
  * bug fix: FOR ... ON ... -clauses in LOOP now work on dotted lists
    (thanks for Teemu Kalvas)
  * bug fix: in FORMAT ~^ inside ~:{ now correctly steps to the next
    case instead of terminating the iteration (thanks for Julian
    Squires, Sean Champ and Raymond Toy)
  * bug fix: incorrect expansion of defgeneric that caused a style
    warning. (thanks for Zach Beane)
  * bug fix: slot accessor effective method computation works properly
    for classes with multiple non-standard applicable methods on
    SB-MOP:SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS.  (reported by Ralf Mattes)
  * on x86 compiler supports stack allocation of results of LIST and
    LIST*, bound to variables, declared DYNAMIC-EXTENT. (based on
    CMUCL implementation by Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** FORMAT strings with both the ~<~:;~> form of the justification
       directive and pretty-printing directives cause an error.

changes in sbcl-0.8.14 relative to sbcl-0.8.13:
  * incompatible change: the internal functions
    SB-KERNEL:32BIT-LOGICAL-FOO, intended for providing efficient
    logical operations on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) values, have been renamed
    to SB-KERNEL:WORD-LOGICAL-FOO.  Modular arithmetic should be used
    instead of the old functions.
  * new feature: on platforms where "dladdr" is available foreign
    function names now appear in backtraces.  (based on Helmut Eller's
    work for CMUCL)
  * documentation: documentation for SB-BSD-SOCKETS, SB-GRAY,
    SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS, and SB-PROFILE have been integrated into the user
    manual.
  * documentation: ASDF manual is now distributed with SBCL.
  * bug fix: SBCL can now load its contributed modules with REQUIRE
    even if the system-provided entries have been removed from
    ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*. Infinite recursion in REQUIRE is also
    detected.

    left shifts.
  * bug fix: provide default methods for INPUT-STREAM-P and
    OUTPUT-STREAM-P specialized on SB-GRAY:FUNDAMENTAL-STREAM.
  * bug fix: improve the detection and resolution of MOP metacycles
    (where effective method computation depends on the generic function
    having its effective method computed).  (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * bug fix: pass the right initargs to :BEFORE or :AFTER methods on
    SHARED-INITIALIZE or INITIALIZE-INSTANCE in optimized
    MAKE-INSTANCE constructors.  (reported by Axel Schairer for cmucl)
  * bug fix: pathnames with relative directory components can be
    represented relative to default pathnames.
  * optimization: in taking the GCD of bignums, reduce the two bignums
    to approximately the same size (using Euclid's algorithm) before
    applying the more sophisticated binary GCD.  (thanks to Juho
    Snellman)
  * optimization: COUNT on bitvectors now operates word-at-a-time.
  * optimization: ASH with a positive, but not necessarily constant,
    (leftwards) shift, when in a modular context, is compiled to a
    hardware shift.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** FORMAT variable parameters ("~V<char>") are defaulted properly
       if the corresponding argument is NIL.
    ** FORMAT directives accepting a minpad parameter treat negative
       values as 0.
    ** literal commas as character parameters to FORMAT directives are
       parsed correctly.
    ** literal spaces directly after ~<Newline> directives within a
       format-logical-block (~:< ~@:>) do not induce :FILL-style
       conditional newlines.
    ** PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT inserts spaces as specified (and only
       as specified: it no longer includes conditional newlines).
    ** PRINC-TO-STRING binds *PRINT-READABLY* to NIL (as well as
       *PRINT-ESCAPE*).
    ** PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK signals a TYPE-ERROR if its :PREFIX or
       :PER-LINE-PREFIX argument does not evaluate to a string.

changes in sbcl-0.8.13 relative to sbcl-0.8.12:
  * new feature: SB-PACKAGE-LOCKS. See the "Package Locks" section of
    the manual for details; for now, package locks can be disabled by
    removing :SB-PACKAGE-LOCKS in customize-target-features.lisp, but
    if no major problems are found then it is likely that they will be
    compiled in unconditionally.
  * major incompatible change: LOAD-FOREIGN and LOAD-1-FOREIGN are now
    unsupported operators on all platforms.  To load a shared library
    into SBCL, use SB-ALIEN:LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT.  To load a non-shared
    object file, link it into a shared library outside of SBCL and
    load it using SB-ALIEN:LOAD-SHARED-OBJECT.  (incidentally fixes
    bug #79)
  * bug workaround: ROOM T and the GC were not working together
    reliably, because invariants expected by the SB!VM:INSTANCE-USAGE
    reporting facility aren't preserved. That reporting has been
    disabled, so now until and unless someone figures out how to make it
    work reliably with the current GC, (ROOM T) is equivalent to (ROOM).
  * minor incompatible change: as threatened around sbcl-0.8.0, the
    home package of MOP-related symbols is now SB-MOP, not SB-PCL.
    The symbols are also exported from SB-PCL for backwards
    compatibility, but more so than before SB-PCL should be treated as
    an implementation-internal package.
  * fasl format changed: SBCL 0.8.13 fasls are incompatible with those
    of earlier versions
  * the SB-SPROF contrib now works on (most) non-x86 architectures.
    It is known as of this release not to work on the Alpha, however.
  * fixed bug #167: errors signalled due to illegal syntax in method
    bodies are now more legible.
  * fixed bug #338: instances of EQL-SPECIFIER are now valid type
    designators and can hence be used with TYPEP.
  * fixed bug #333: CHECK-TYPE now ensures that the type error
    signalled, if any, has the right object to be accessed by
    TYPE-ERROR-DATUM.  (reported by Tony Martinez)
  * fixed bug #340: SETF of VALUES obeys the specification in ANSI
    5.1.2.3 for multiple-value place subforms.  (reported by Kalle
    Olavi Niemetalo)
  * fixed bug #334: programmatic addition of slots using specialized
    methods on SB-MOP:COMPUTE-SLOTS works for :ALLOCATION :INSTANCE
    and :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots.
  * fixed bug #269: SCALE-FLOAT scales floats by any integer, not just
    float exponents.  (rereported by Peter Seibel)
  * fixed a bug: #\Space (and other whitespace characters) are no
    longer considered to be macro characters in standard syntax by
    GET-MACRO-CHARACTER.
  * fixed bug: initialization of condition class metaobjects no longer
    causes an instance of the condition to be created.  (reported by
    Marco Baringer)
  * fixed bug: it is now possible to have slots such that
    SB-MOP:SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION of the effective slot
    description is neither :INSTANCE nor :CLASS.
  * fixed bug: the ctor optimization of MAKE-INSTANCE now respects
    user-defined methods on SLOT-BOUNDP-USING-CLASS and (SETF
    SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS), and no longer causes errors with
    non-standard SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION values.
  * fixed bugs: various race conditions handling exiting threads.
    CL-PPCRE's thread torture test now passes.
  * fixed arguably-a-bug: GC time proportional to number of threads in
    system even when most of them are idle
  * optimization: improved performance of BIT and SBIT on bit-vectors.
  * .fasl file incompatibility: The fasl file version number has
    been incremented because of changes associated with package locks.

changes in sbcl-0.8.12 relative to sbcl-0.8.11:
  * minor incompatible change: the system no longer provides
    optimization hints (conditions which are TYPEP
    SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE) for conforming code in default compilation
    mode; these hints are still emitted when higher SPEED optimization
    is requested.
  * new contrib module: a sampling profiler (profiling by statistical
    sampling, rather than by instrumenting functions) is available as
    the SB-SPROF contrib.  (thanks to Gerd Moellmann and Juho Snellman)
  * the behaviour of the standard function ED is now customizeable by
    third parties through a hook variable: see ED's documentation
    string for information on the protocol.
  * the compiler no longer emits efficiency notes for (FUNCALL X)
    when the type of X is uncertain under default optimization
    settings.
  * fixed bug 276: mutating a binding of a specialized parameter to a
    method to something that is not TYPEP the specializer is now
    possible.
  * fixed bugs 45d and 118: DOUBLE-FLOAT[-NEGATIVE]-EPSILON now
    exhibit the required behaviour on the x86 platform.  (thanks to
    Peter van Eynde, Eric Marsden and Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug 335: ATANH now computes the inverse hyperbolic tangent
    even for difficult arguments.  (reported by Peter Graves)
  * fixed bug 141a: the backquote printer now descends quoted
    structure.
  * fixed another bug in backquote printing: no more destructive
    modification of the form's list structure.  (reported by Brian
    Downing)
  * fixed bug in INTERRUPT-THREAD: pin the function, so that it cannot
    move between its address being taken and the call to
    interrupt_thread, fixing a crashing race condition.
  * the SB-POSIX contrib implementation has been adjusted so that it
    no longer exhibits ridiculously poor performance when constructing
    instances corresponding to C structs.

changes in sbcl-0.8.11 relative to sbcl-0.8.10:
  * minor incompatible change: the sb-grovel contrib now treats C
    structures as alien (in the sense of SB-ALIEN) objects rather than
    as undistinguished (simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))s.  This
    has implications for memory management of client code
    (sb-grovel-returned objects must now be manually managed) and for
    type safety (alien objects now have full types).
  * new feature: the SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS declaration should be
    used to control emission of compiler diagnostics, rather than the
    SB-EXT:INHIBIT-WARNINGS OPTIMIZE quality.  See the manual for
    documentation on this feature.  The SB-EXT:INHIBIT-WARNINGS
    quality should be considered deprecated.
  * install.sh now installs the user manual as well
  * (not quite a new documentable feature, but worth considering in
    the light of the new SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS declaration): the
    beginnings of a semantically meaningful condition hierarchy is
    under development, for use in SB-EXT:MUFFLE-CONDITIONS and by
    IDEs.
  * fixed bug: PARSE-NAMESTRING now accepts any valid pathaname
    designator as the defaults argument.
  * fixed bug: Displaced arrays whose displaced-to array has become
    too small now cause ARRAY-DIMENSION to signal an error, providing
    for safer bounds-checking. (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug: DEFCLASS slot definitions with identical :READER and
    :WRITER names now signal a reasonable error. (reported by Thomas
    Burdick)
  * fixed bug: CLOSE :ABORT T on appending stream no longer causes
    file deletion.
  * fixed bug: Invalid slot specification errors now print correctly.
    (thanks to Zach Beane)
  * fixed bug 320: Shared to local slot value transfers in class
    redefinitions now happen corrently from superclasses as
    well. (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug 316: SHIFTF now accepts VALUES forms. (reported by Bruno
    Haible)
  * fixed bug 322: DEFSTRUCT :TYPE LIST type predicates now handle
    improper lists correctly. (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug 313: source-transform for <fun-name> was erroneously
    applied to a call of a value of a variable with name <fun-name>.
    (reported by Antonio Menezes Leitao)
  * fixed bug 307: The obsolete instance protocol ensures that
    subclasses are properly obsoleted.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * fixed bug 298, revealed by Paul F. Dietz' test suite: SBCL can
    remove dead unknown-values globs from the middle of the stack.
  * added a new restart to *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS* handling to make it
    easier to resume long computations after using *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS*
    to diagnose and fix failures.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * fixed bug reported by PFD in lisppaste #747 (and Bruno Haible from
    CLISP test suite): WRITE-TO-STRING is not constant-foldable.
  * fixed bugs in COMPLEX type specifier: UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE
    is now consistent with (COMPLEX <x>); bugs in treatment of COMPLEX
    MEMBER and UNION types have likewise been fixed.  (thanks to Bruno
    Haible)
  * fixed a (fairly theoretical) bug in string printing: if
    *PRINT-READABLY* is true, signal PRINT-NOT-READABLE if the string
    does not have array-element-type equal to the most general string
    type.
  * fixed bug: SET-PPRINT-DISPATCH does not immediately resolve
    function name. (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * fixed bug: compile-time format string checker failed on
    non-closed ~{.  (reported by Thomas F Burdick)
  * fixed bug: as reported by Kalle Olavi Niemitalo on #lisp IRC,
    don't warn on legal loop code involving more than one aggregate
    boolean.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * fixed bug: as reported by Peter Graves on #lisp IRC, passing a NIL
    in keyword position to MAKE-PACKAGE was not being reported as
    invalid.
  * fixed bug: as reported by Juan Ripoll on cmucl-imp,
    MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND should be able to lexically bind lambda list
    keywords.
  * fixed bugs 280 and 312: the checking for multiple definitions in a
    file is less likely to become confused by uses of inline
    functions.
  * fixed bug: the #S reader macro performs the keyword coercion
    specified for slot names.  (reported by Kalle Niemitalo)
  * fixed bug: lambda lists may contain symbols whose names start with
    & but are not lambda-list-keywords; their occurrence triggers a
    STYLE-WARNING.
  * fixed bug 321: define-method-combination argument lambda lists do
    not cause invalid code to be generated when &optional or &aux
    variables have default values.  (reported by Bruno Haible)
  * fixed bug 327: system subclasses of STRUCTURE-OBJECT or CONDITION
    have CLOS classes; this appears also to have fixed reported
    instability in stack exhaustion detection.
  * fixed bug: the CONTROL-ERROR from ABORT, CONTINUE and
    MUFFLE-WARNING when no associated restart is present is now
    printable.
  * optimization: rearranged the expansion of various defining macros
    so that each expands into only one top-level form in a
    :LOAD-TOPLEVEL context; this appears to decrease fasl sizes by
    approximately 10%.
  * optimization: used a previously little-used slot in symbols to
    cache SXHASH values, yielding a 5-10% compiler speedup.  (thanks
    to Juho Snellman)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** MAKE-INSTANCES-OBSOLETE returns the class name when called with
       a symbol.
    ** Fixed an optimization bug related to inheritance of initforms
       from local to shared slots.
    ** FILE-POSITION works as specified on BROADCAST-STREAMs.
    ** CAST optimizer forgot to flush argument derived type.
    ** print/read consistency on floats is now orders of magnitude
       more likely.  (thanks also to Bruno Haible for a similar report
       and discussions)
    ** removed stack cleaning in the cleanup part of UNWIND-PROTECT.
    ** IMAGPART is specified (infelicitously) to return (* 0 <thing>)
       for objects of type REAL.  Make it so.
    ** SXHASH is specified (infelicitously) to respect similarity,
       which means that (SXHASH 0.0) must equal (SXHASH -0.0).  Make
       it so.  (thanks to Markus Ziegler)
    ** on the Alpha, the compiler succeeds in compiling functions
       returning a known number of arguments greater than 63.
    ** fixed handling of invalid NIL arguments in keyword position
       in local calls.
    ** fixed non-pretty printing of arrays with *PRINT-RADIX* being
       true.
    ** provided a readably-printable representation for RANDOM-STATE
       objects.
    ** ensured that pathnames, where they have a namestring, always
       print using #P"..." syntax.

changes in sbcl-0.8.10 relative to sbcl-0.8.9:
  * Support for the forthcoming 2.0 version of the NetBSD kernel
    running on x86 hardware has been added.  (thanks to Perry
    E. Metzger most immediately, and others for their past work)
  * SBCL now runs on OpenBSD 3.4. (Thanks to Scott Parish; 3.4 is the
    current release version; SBCL's OpenBSD support had been broken
    since about the time of OpenBSD's switch to ELF binary format.)
  * [placeholder for DX summary]
    ** user code with &REST lists declared dynamic-extent, under high
       speed or space and low safety and debug optimization policy.
  * The manual has been converted to Texinfo format and the debugger
    chapter from the cmucl manual has been added.
  * A facility has been added to extract documentation strings from
    sbcl and store them as Texinfo-formatted snippets for inclusion in
    the manual (via Texinfo's @include directive)
  * bug fix: compiler emitted division in optimized DEREF.  (thanks for
    the test case to Dave Roberts)
  * bug fix: multidimensional simple arrays loaded from FASLs had fill
    pointers.  (reported by Sean Ross)
  * bug fix: PROFILE output is printed nicely even for large numerical
    values.  (thanks to Zach Beane)
  * bug fix: streams with element-type (SIGNED-BYTE <N>) for <N>
    greater than 32 handle EOF correctly.
  * bug fix: on X86 an immediate argument of the IMUL instruction is
    correctly printed in disassembly. (thanks to Lutz Euler)
  * bug fix: class slots in redefined classes preserve their old
    values.  (thanks to Bruno Haible and Nikodemus Siivola)
  * bug fix: compilation of funcalls of CXX+R (e.g. CDDR) now
    succeeds.  (reported by Marco Baringer)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** READ-SEQUENCE now works on ECHO-STREAMs.
    ** RATIONALIZE works more according to its specification.  (thanks
       to Bruno Haible)

changes in sbcl-0.8.9 relative to sbcl-0.8.8:
  * deprecation of old extension: *DEBUG-PRINT-LEVEL* and
    *DEBUG-PRINT-LENGTH* are now deprecated in favor of the new, more
    general SB-DEBUG:*DEBUG-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST* mechanism. (This
    should matter to you only if you rebind the printer control
    variables and then find you want different bindings in the
    debugger than in the ordinary execution of your program.)
  * The runtime build system has been tweaked to support building
    (on SPARC/SunOS) using a C compiler which invokes Sun's own
    assembler and linker.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * Unbound, undefined, undeclared variables now trigger full
    WARNINGs, not just STYLE-WARNINGs, on the assumption that this is
    more often programmer error than deliberate exploitation of undefined
    behaviour.
  * optimization: the hash algorithm for strings has changed to one
    that is less vulnerable to spurious collisions.  (thanks to Juho
    Snellman)
  * optimization: VECTOR-POP, VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and REPLACE do less
    needless bounds checking.  (thanks to Juho Snellman)
  * optimization: implemented multiplication as a modular
    (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) operation on the PPC backend.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** ADJUST-ARRAY now copies the datum in a zero rank array if
       required.
    ** ADJUST-ARRAY no longer adjusts non-adjustable arrays.
    ** MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM accepts NIL as a value for :END.
    ** MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM functions correctly for strings with
       element-type NIL.
    ** CLEAR-INPUT accepts NIL and T for its (optional) stream
       argument.
    ** Ratios can now be printed correctly with *PRINT-BASE* bound to
       2, 8 or 16.
    ** ECHO-STREAMs no longer attempt to echo the end of file value to
       their output stream on EOF from read.
    ** CONCATENATED-STREAM-STREAMS discards constituent streams which
       have been read to end-of-file.
    ** CLOSE works as expected on the null CONCATENATED-STREAM, and on
       STRING-STREAMS.
    ** Printing symbols with *PRINT-CASE* :CAPITALIZE respects the
       description of determination of which consecutive characters
       constitute a word.
    ** Printing the "Space" character with escaping on now yields "#\\ ",
       rather than "#\\Space", as mandated by ANSI 22.1.3.2.
    ** Reading floating-point numbers with *READ-BASE* set to a number
       less than 10 works correctly.
    ** Reading floating-point numbers with *READ-BASE* set to a number
       more than 10 works correctly.
    ** Printing with *PRINT-READABLY* targets the standard readtable, not
       the readtable currently in effect.

changes in sbcl-0.8.8 relative to sbcl-0.8.7:
  * minor incompatible change: parsing of namestrings on a physical
    (Unix) host has changed; numbers after the final #\. in a
    namestring are no longer interpreted as a version field.  This is
    intented to be largely invisible to the user, except that the
    meaning of the namestring "*.*.*" has changed: it now refers to a
    pathname with :TYPE :WILD :NAME #<pattern "*.*">.  This namestring
    should usually be replaced by
      (make-pathname :name :wild :type :wild :version :wild)
    with the added benefit that this is more likely to be portable.
    As a consequence of this change, the :IF-EXISTS :NEW-VERSION
    option to OPEN now signals an error if the file being opened
    exists; this may have an impact on existing code.
  * fixed bug 190: RUN-PROGRAM should now work properly, respecting
    signals received, on the PowerPC platforms (both Linux and
    Darwin).  (thanks to Pierre Mai for pointing out the location of
    the error)
  * several fixes on OS X: The system now builds and runs cleanly on
    Panther (10.3), and works around sigreturn bug (no more SIGFPEs).
    (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook)
  * bug fix: DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME now accepts timezone arguments with
    second-resolution: integer multiples of 1/3600 between -24 and 24.
    (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * bug fix: functions =, /=, <, <=, >, >= did not check the argument
    type when called with 1 argument; PEEK-CHAR checked type of
    PEEK-TYPE only after having read first character from a
    stream.  (reported by Peter Graves)
  * bug fix: the garbage collector now has much better locality
    behaviour, and in particular no longer treats all memory as being
    exhausted when many small objects point to each other in a deeply
    recursive manner.
  * bug fix: arrays specialized on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 15) are now
    recognized as being TYPEP their class.
  * bug fix: the PUSHNEW documentation string has been corrected.
    (thanks to Vincent Arkesteijn)
  * bug fix: defaulting of the value for the last of an atypically
    large number of multiple values being bound was not being
    performed correctly on the Alpha or PPC platforms
  * optimization: implemented multiplication as a modular
    (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) operation on the x86 backend.
  * optimization: SEARCH on simple-base-strings can now be open-coded.
    (see also contrib/compiler-extras.lisp for inspiration for
    teaching the compiler about the Boyer-Moore algorithm).
  * value, returned by MAX (and MIN) called with several EQUALP, but
    not EQL, arguments now does not depend on compiler settings.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** in stack analysis liveness information is propagated from
       non-local entry points.
    ** pathwise CAST removing failed when the CAST node did not start
       a block.
    ** INPUT-STREAM-P, OUTPUT-STREAM-P, STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE and
       OPEN-STREAM-P signal a TYPE-ERROR if their argument is not a
       stream.
    ** LOAD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-TRANSLATIONS returns NIL if the logical
       host is already defined.
    ** RENAME-FILE works on streams instead of signalling an internal
       type error.
    ** PEEK-CHAR uses the current readtable when determining whether
       or not a character is whitespace.
    ** MERGE-PATHNAMES handles the case when the pathname does not
       specify a name while the default-pathname specifies a version.
    ** Pathnames now stand a better chance of respecting print/read
       consistency.
    ** Attempting to use standardized file system operators with a
       pathname with invalid :DIRECTORY components signals a
       FILE-ERROR.
    ** OPEN :DIRECTION :IO no longer fails to work on non-existent
       files.
    ** DIRECTORY on logical pathnames is more correct.
    ** CLEAR-INPUT, CLEAR-OUTPUT, FINISH-OUTPUT and FORCE-OUTPUT
       signal a TYPE-ERROR if their argument is not a stream.
    ** READ-BYTE and WRITE-BYTE signal a TYPE-ERROR if their stream
       designator argument does not designate a stream.
    ** OPEN-STREAM-P and INPUT-STREAM-P on synonym streams work by
       examining the synonym.
    ** STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE and FRESH-LINE on broadcast-streams now
       work as specified.
    ** OPEN and WITH-OPEN-STREAM allow opening streams with
       element-type larger than ([UN]SIGNED-BYTE 32).

changes in sbcl-0.8.7 relative to sbcl-0.8.6:
  * When built with the :SB-FUTEX feature, threaded builds now take
    advantage of the "fast userspace mutex" facility in Linux kernel 2.6
    for faster/more reliable mutex and condition variable support.
  * Incompatible change (but one you probably shouldn't have been using
    anyway): the interface and code for arbitrating between multiple
    threads in the same user session has been redesigned.
  * bug fix: GET-SETF-EXPANSION no longer throws an internal type
    error when called without an explicit environment argument.
    (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * bug fix: buffered :DIRECTION :IO streams are less likely to become
    confused about their position.  (thanks to Adam Warner and Gerd
    Moellmann)
  * bug fix: Pretty printing backquoted forms with unquotations in the
    argument list position of various code constructs such as LAMBDA
    now works correctly.  (reported by Paul Dietz)
  * bug fix: Pretty printing unquotations no longer loses all
    stream position information.
  * optimization: performance of string output streams is now less
    poor for multiple small sequence writes.
  * optimization: performance of CSUBTYPEP in the presence of complex
    expressions involving CONS and NOT many times has been improved.
    (reported by Paul Dietz)
  * ASDF-INSTALL bug fix: now parses *PROXY* properly.  (thanks to
    Sean Ross)
  * SB-SIMPLE-STREAMS enhancement: simple-streams can now be used as
    streams for the REPL, for the debugger, and so on.  (thanks to
    David Licteblau)
  * DEFINE-CODITION is more efficient.  (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** the value of the :REHASH-THRESHOLD argument to MAKE-HASH-TABLE
       is ignored if it is too small, rather than propagating through
       to cause DIVIDE-BY-ZERO or FLOATING-POINT-OVERFLOW errors.
    ** extremely complex negations of CONS types were not being
       sufficiently canonicalized, leading to inconsistencies in
       SUBTYPEP.
    ** VALUES tranformer lost derived type.

changes in sbcl-0.8.6 relative to sbcl-0.8.5:
  * fixed a bootstrapping bug: the build process no longer assumes
    that the various BOOLE-related constants have the same value in
    host and target lisps.  (noted by Paul Dietz' test suite on an
    SBCL binary built from CLISP)
  * The system can now be dynamically linked on the MIPS platform,
    which enables dynamic loading of foreign code from Lisp.  (thanks
    to Ralf Baechle for discussions on the MIPS ABI)
  * The system now records debugging information for its own source
    files in a filesystem-position-independent manner, relative to
    the "SYS" logical host.
  * fixed a compiler bug: MV-LET convertion did not check references
    to the "max args" entry point.  (reported by Brian Downing)
  * tweaked disassembly notes to be less confident about proclaiming
    some instruction as an LRA.  (thanks to Brian Downing)
  * contrib update: SB-ACLREPL is now threadsafe; multiple listeners
    now each have their own history, command character, and other
    characteristics.  (thanks to David Lichteblau)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** compiler failure in compiling LOGAND expressions including a
       constant 0
    ** Implementation of ASH-MOD32 on X86 and PPC did not work for the
       shift greater than 32.
    ** FLUSH-DEST did not mark blocks for type check regeneration.
    ** HANDLER-CASE failed to accept declarations in handler clauses
       in some circumstances.

changes in sbcl-0.8.5 relative to sbcl-0.8.4:
  * New code in contrib/sb-introspect (still probably not entirely
    stable yet) provides some support for smart Lisp development
    environments like SLIME.
  * The conditions signalled for errors occurring when loading .fasl
    files have been systematized (inheriting from SB-EXT:INVALID-FASL)
    in a way which should help ASDF recover gracefully.
  * The REQUIRE/PROVIDE behavior of *MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTIONS*
    stuff has been cleaned up. If you code contrib/ stuff, this might
    affect you, and you can look at contrib/README, contrib/STANDARDS,
    and/or the 0.8.4.27 diff to check.
  * In full calls the compiler now does not generate checks for declared
    argument types for all arguments.
  * various threading fixes
    ** and some experimental patches which didn't make it into
       the main tree for this release, but which are shipped in
       contrib/experimental-thread.patch as a possible fix for some
       failures (deadlock, spinning...) in GC-intensive multithreaded
       applications.
  * fixed PPC build problem (source code incompatibility of different
    library versions): added offsetof() hackery which attempts to divine
    where glibc maintainers put uc_mcontext today
  * fixed bug 282: compiler does not trust type assertions while passing
    arguments to a full call.
  * fixed bug 261: compiler allows NIL or "no value" to be accepted for
    &OPTIONAL VALUES type parameter.
  * fix bug 214: algorithm for noting rejected templates is now more
    similar to that of template seletion. (also reported by rydis on
    #lisp)
  * fixed bug 141b: printing backquoted information readably and prettily
    inserts a space where necessary.
  * bug fix: obviously wrong type specifiers such as (FIXNUM 1) or
    (CHARACTER 10) are now reported as errors, rather than propagated
    as unknown types.  (reported by piso on #lisp)
  * bug fix: the :IF-EXISTS argument to OPEN now behaves correctly
    with values NIL and :ERROR.  (thanks to Milan Zamazal)
  * fixed bug 191c: CLOS now does proper keyword argument checking as
    described in CLHS 7.6.5 and 7.6.5.1.
  * bug fix: LOOP forms using NIL as a for-as-arithmetic counter no
    longer raise an error; further, using a list as a for-as-arithmetic
    counter now raises a meaningful error.
  * fixed bug 213a: even fairly unreasonable CONS type specifiers are
    now understood by sequence creation functions such as MAKE-SEQUENCE
    and COERCE.
  * fixed bug 46k: READ-BYTE now signals an error when asked to read from
    a STRING-INPUT-STREAM.
  * compiler enhancement: SIGNUM is now better able to derive the type
    of its result.
  * type declarations inside WITH-SLOTS are checked.  (reported by
    salex on #lisp)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** incorrect optimization of TRUNCATE for a positive first
       argument and negative second.
    ** compiler failure in let-convertion during flushing dead code.
    ** compiler failure while deriving type of TRUNCATE on an
       interval, containing 0.
    ** ASH of a negative bignum by a negative bignum count now returns
       -1, not 0.
    ** intersection of CONS types now canonicalizes properly, fixing
       inconsistencies in SUBTYPEP.

changes in sbcl-0.8.4 relative to sbcl-0.8.3:
  * incompatible change: The --disable-debugger command line
    option now clobbers the debugger at a more fundamental
    level, by redefining #'INVOKE-DEBUGGER instead of by
    rebinding *DEBUGGER-HOOK*. The main difference is that BREAK
    is specified by ANSI to ignore *DEBUGGER-HOOK* and
    INVOKE-DEBUGGER regardless. Under the old system, BREAK would
    enter the debugger REPL and then suffer recursive errors
    because *DEBUG-IO* is also messed up in --disable-debugger mode;
    while under the new system, BREAK in --disable-debugger mode
    terminates the system just as an unhandled error would.
  * fixed compiler performance when processing loops with a step >1;
  * bug fix: DOCUMENTATION now retrieves generic function
    documentation.  Also, DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION)
    support has been systematized, and now supports the methods
    specified by ANSI, along with a default method and a method for
    slot documentation.  (reported by Nathan Froyd)
  * bug fix: effective methods associated with a generic function are
    no longer cached over a change of that generic function's method
    combination.  (reported by Andreas Fuchs)
  * bug fix: RUN-PROGRAM now does not fail if some element in $PATH
    names a non-existent directory.  (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)
  * bug fix: ROUND and TRUNCATE could, under certain circumstances on
    the PPC platform, lead to stack corruption; this has been fixed.
    (reported by Rainer Joswig)
  * bug fix: ASH on an (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) with a shift of -32 or lower
    no longer ever returns 1 instead of 0.  (thanks to Lars Brinkhoff)
  * fixed bug 285: TRUNCATE on bignum arguments, and indeed bignum
    arithmetic in general, is now much more reliable on the PPC
    platform.
  * bug fix: LOGCOUNT on (UNSIGNED-BYTE 64) objects on the Alpha
    platform now returns the right answer.
  * optimization: restored some effective method precomputation in
    CLOS (turned off by an ANSI fix in sbcl-0.8.3); the amount of
    precomputation is now tunable.
  * optimization: compiler-internal data structure use has been
    reviewed, and changes have been made that should improve the
    performance of the compiler by about 20%.
  * optimization: performance of FILL (and :INITIAL-ELEMENT) on
    simple-base-strings and simple-bit-vectors is improved.
  * optimization: the optimization of 32-bit logical and arithmetic
    functions introduced in version 0.8.3 on the x86 has been
    implemented on the mips, ppc and sparc platforms; an
    implementation of the same facility, but for 64-bit arithmetic,
    has been added for the alpha.
  * microoptimization: the compiler is better able to make use of the
    x86 LEA instruction for multiplication by constants.
  * bug fix: in some situations compiler did not report usage of
    generic arithmetic in (SPEED 3) policy.
  * bug 145b fix: compiler used wrong type specifier while converting
    MEMBER-types to numeric.
  * bug fix: COMPILE-FILE must bind *READTABLE*. (reported by Doug
    McNaught)
  * bug fix: (SETF AREF) on byte-sized-element arrays with constant
    index argument now works properly on the Alpha platform.
  * bug fix: floating point exception treatment on the Alpha platform
    is improved.
  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION works much better on string input and
    output streams.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * bug fix: many threading/garbage collection symptoms sorted.
    SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD now safe to call on a thread that
    might be pseudo-atomic.
  * internal change: Stopping for GC is now done with signals not
    ptrace. GC is now done in whichever thread wanted it, instead of
    in the parent.
  * bug fix: GC hooks (missing since 0.8) reinstated, so finalizers
    work again.
  * bug fix: result form in DO is not contained in the implicit
    TAGBODY.
  * incompatible change: ICR structure is changed; the value part of
    CONTINUATION is now called LVAR; corresponding functions are
    renamed (e.g. SB-C::CONTINUATION-TYPE has become SB-C::LVAR-TYPE).
  * added type deriver for ISQRT (thanks to Robert E. Brown).
  * bug fix: better support for loading from the command line when an
    initialization file sets (READTABLE-CASE *READTABLE*).  (thanks
    to Adam Warner)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** the RETURN clause in LOOP is now equivalent to DO (RETURN ...).
    ** ROUND and FROUND now give the right answer when given very
       small float arguments.
    ** (FLOAT X) for X of type DOUBLE-FLOAT now returns X in all
       circumstances.
    ** optimizer for (EXPT X 0) did not work for X not of type FLOAT.
    ** (GCD 0 <negative-integer>) returned <negative-integer>.
    ** LCM should return a non-negative integer.
    ** PARSE-INTEGER returned the index of a terminator instead of the
       upper bounding index of a substring in case :JUNK-ALLOWED NIL.
    ** PARSE-INTEGER returned an incorrect index being applied to a
       displaced string.
    ** LCM with two arguments of 0 returns 0 rather than signalling
       DIVISION-BY-ZERO.
    ** unsigned addition of a 32-bit constant with the high bit set no
       longer causes an internal compiler error on the x86.
    ** LOGBITP accepts a non-negative bignum as its INDEX argument.
    ** compiler incorrectly derived types of DPB and DEPOSIT-FIELD
       with negative last argument.
    ** byte specifiers with zero size and position no longer cause
       an error during type derivation.
    ** bignum multiplication on the Alpha platform now returns the
       right answer.
  * porting: The system now builds on SuSE AMD64, although it still
    generates a 32-bit binary.
  * .fasl file incompatibility: The fasl file version number has
    been incremented (because of the changes to internal compiler
    data structures referred to above).

changes in sbcl-0.8.3 relative to sbcl-0.8.2:
  * SBCL now builds and runs on MacOS X (version 10.2), or perhaps
    more accurately, on the Darwin kernel running on PowerPC hardware.
    (thanks to Brian Mastenbrook, Pierre Mai and Patrik Nordebo)
  * Compiler code deletion notes now signal a condition of type
    SB-EXT:CODE-DELETION-NOTE (a subtype of SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE) with
    an associated MUFFLE-WARNING restart.
  * The compiler now performs limited argument count validation of
    constant format strings in FORMAT, and where appropriate in ERROR,
    CERROR and WARN.  (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * New ASDF-INSTALL contrib can be used for automatic download and
    installation of third-party Lisp code from CCLAN or other sites
    via CLiki.
  * Threaded builds (:SB-THREAD) now support SB-THREAD:INTERRUPT-THREAD,
    which forces another thread to execute a function supplied by the
    caller.
  * bug 75 fix: WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING (and MAKE-STRING-OUTPUT-STREAM)
    now accept and act upon their :ELEMENT-TYPE keyword argument.
    (reported by Martin Atzmueller, Edi Weitz)
  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION now accepts position designators up to
    ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT or the extreme of the off_t range, whichever
    is the greater.  (thanks to Patrik Nordebo)
  * bug fix: MAKE-ARRAY ignored :INITIAL-CONTENTS NIL. (reported by
    Kalle Olavi Niemitalo)
  * bug fix: the CLASS-PROTOTYPE of the GENERIC-FUNCTION class is now
    printable.  (reported by Eric Marsden)
  * bug fix in sb-posix: mmap() now works on systems with a 64-bit
    off_t, including Darwin and FreeBSD.  (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)
  * x86 bug fix in control stack exhaustion checking: now shows backtrace
  * bug fix in WITH-TIMEOUT: now the body can have more than one form.
    (thanks to Stig Sandoe)
  * bug fix in READ-SEQUENCE: READ-SEQUENCE following PEEK-CHAR or
    UNREAD-CHAR now correctly includes the unread character in the
    target sequence.  (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * bug fix in threaded builds: the system can now be suspended and
    resumed by shell job control with minimal disruption.
  * bug fixes in times and timezones >2038AD
  * better handling of "where is GNU make?" problem in build scripts
    (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * new optimization: inside a named function any reference to a
    function with the same name is considered to be a self-reference;
    this behaviour is controlled with SB-C::RECOGNIZE-SELF-CALLS
    optimization quality.
  * new optimization on x86: logical functions and + now have
    optimized (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32) versions, which are automatically
    used when the result is truncated to 32 bits.
  * VALUES declaration is partially enabled.
  * fixes in SB-GROVEL (thanks to Andreas Fuchs)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** The system now obeys the constraint imposed by
       UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE that the upgraded array element
       types form a lattice under type intersection.
    ** FFLOOR, FTRUNCATE, FCEILING and FROUND work with integers.
    ** ASSOC now ignores NIL elements in an alist.
    ** CEILING now gives the right answer with MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM
       and (1+ MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM) answers.
    ** The addition of a method with invalid qualifiers to a generic
       function does not cause an error to be signalled immediately;
       a warning is signalled, and the error is generated only on
       calling the generic function.
  * changed .fasl file version number, in part to add type codes for
    new array subtypes UNSIGNED-BYTE 7, 15, 29, and 31 mandated by
    obscure ANSI requirements

changes in sbcl-0.8.2 relative to sbcl-0.8.1:
  * fixed bug 148: failure to inline-expand a local function left
    garbage, confusing the compiler.
  * fixed bugs 3cd: structure slot readers perform type check if the
    slot can have an invalid value (i.e. it is either not initialized
    or can be written with a less specific slot writer).
  * bug fix: the compiler now traps array references to elements off
    the end of an array; previously, the bounds checking in some
    circumstances could go off-by-one.
  * improved MACHINE-VERSION, especially on Linux (thanks to Lars
    Brinkhoff)
  * type declarations for array element types now obey the description
    on the CLHS page "Declaration TYPE", as per discussions on
    sbcl-help around 2003-05-08.  This means that a declaration
    (TYPE (ARRAY FOO) BAR) means that, within the scope of the
    declaration, all references to BAR will be asserted or assumed
    (with THE, so dependent on compiler policy) to involve objects of
    type FOO.  Note that no such declaration is implied in
    (MAKE-ARRAY .. :ELEMENT-TYPE 'FOO).
  * declared types of functions from the "Conditions"
    chapter. (reported by Paul Dietz)
  * bug fix: CERROR accepts a function as its first argument.
  * bug fix: NTH an NTHCDR accept a bignum as index
    arguments. (reported by Adam Warner)
  * optimization: character compare routines now optimize comparing
    against a constant character. (reported by Gilbert Baumann)
  * bug fix: (SETF AREF) on byte-sized-element arrays with constant index
    argument now works properly on the MIPS platform.
  * fixed compiler failure on (TYPEP x '(NOT (MEMBER 0d0))).
  * repeated evaluation of the same DEFSTRUCT, a slot of which is
    declared to have a functional type, does not cause an error
    anymore.
  * fixed bug: sometimes MAKE-INSTANCE did not work with classes with
    many :DEFAULT-INITARGS. (reported by Istvan Marko)
  * fixed bug: if last continuation of a deleted block has a
    destination, this destination should be deleted too. (reported by
    ohler on #lisp)
  * fixed a bug in the bootstrap process: the host compiler's values
    of ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT and ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT no longer leak
    into the newly-built SBCL. (reported by Eric Marsden on #lisp,
    test case from Patrik Nordebo)
  * improved the ability of the disassembler on the PPC platform to
    provide helpful disassembly notes.
  * SB-MOP:CLASS-PROTOTYPE on built-in-classes returns an instance of
    the class in more cases than previously.
  * bug fix: FILE-POSITION now understands :START and :END for
    STRING-INPUT-STREAMs.  (thanks to Nikodemus Siivola)
  * bug fix: (SIGNED-BYTE 8) streams no longer return (UNSIGNED-BYTE
    8) data.  (thanks to David Lichteblau)
  * bug fix: it is possible to add a method to a generic function
    without lambda list.
  * bug fix: reader failed to signal END-OF-FILE inside an
    object representation. (reported by Nikodemus Siivola)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** LAST and [N]BUTLAST should accept a bignum.
    ** condition slot accessors are methods.
    ** (VECTOR NIL) is a subtype of STRING.

changes in sbcl-0.8.1 relative to sbcl-0.8.0:
  * minor incompatible change: some nonsensical specialized lambda
    lists (used in DEFMETHOD) which were previously ignored now signal
    errors.
  * minor incompatible change: the system is now aware of the types of
    variables in the COMMON-LISP package, and will signal errors for
    most violations of these type constraints (where previously they
    were silently accepted).
  * minor incompatible change: COMPILE-FILE now uses the freedom
    afforded (ANSI 3.2.2.3) to use derived function types for
    functions defined in the same file. This also permits the system
    to warn on static type mismatches and function
    redefinition.  (Currently it does not work with high DEBUG level.)
  * minor incompatible change: VALUES declaration is disabled.
  * When issuing notes, the compiler now signals a condition of type
    SB-EXT:COMPILER-NOTE, and provides an associated MUFFLE-WARNING
    restart for use in user handlers.  It is expected that the
    COMPILER-NOTE condition will eventually become a condition
    supertype to a hierarchy of note types, which will then be
    handleable in a similar fashion. However, at the moment, no such
    note subtypes yet exist. (SB-INT:SIMPLE-COMPILER-NOTE exists,
    but it's an implementation detail, not a classification for the
    purpose above.)
  * Changes in type checking closed the following bugs:
    ** type checking of unused values (192b, 194d, 203);
    ** template selection based on unsafe type assertions (192c, 236);
    ** type checking in branches (194bc).
  * A short form of VALUES type specifier has ANSI meaning (it has
    increased the number of situations when SBCL cannot perform type
    checking).
  * fixed bug in DEFSTRUCT: once again, naming structure slots with
    keywords or constants is permissible.
  * STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE and STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE now have methods
    defined on the relevant FUNDAMENTAL-BINARY-{INPUT,OUTPUT}-STREAM
    classes.  (thanks to Antonio Martinez)
  * improved ANSIness in DESCRIBE: The DESCRIBE function no longer
    outputs FRESH-LINE or TERPRI, and no longer converts its stream
    argument to a pretty-print stream. Instead, it leaves any such
    operations to DESCRIBE-OBJECT methods.
  * bug fix: APROPOS now respects the EXTERNAL-ONLY flag. (reported
    by Teemu Kalvas)
  * bug fix: NIL is now a valid destructuring argument in DEFMACRO
    lambda lists. (thanks to David Lichteblau)
  * bug fix: Defining a generic function with a :METHOD-CLASS being a
    subclass of STANDARD-METHOD no longer causes stack exhaustion.
    (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed bug 246: increased compilation speed of long
    MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (and likewise of NTH-VALUE with a constant
    integer argument)
  * a contributed module implementing COMPILER-LET and MACROEXPAND-ALL
    has been included.
  * DEFCONSTANT now throws a condition of type
    SB-EXT:DEFCONSTANT-UNEQL if it is being asked to redefine a
    constant to a non-EQL value; CONTINUE and ABORT restarts
    respectively change and preserve the value.
  * fixed bug 63: The code walker, part of the implementation of CLOS,
    is now better at handling symbol macros.
  * bug fix: There is no longer an internal implementation type named
    CL:LENGTH. (reported by Raymond Toy)
  * bug fix: In macro-like defining macros/special operators the
    implicit block does not enclose the lambda list.
  * fixed bugs 10 and 43: Bare VALUES, AND, OR and MEMBER symbols (not
    enclosed in parentheses) are not suitable as type specifiers, and
    their use properly signals an error now.
  * bug fix: An argument count mismatch for a type specifier in code
    being compiled no longer causes an unhandled error at compile
    time, but signals a compile-time warning.
  * fixed simple vector readable printing
  * bug fix: DESCRIBE takes more care over whether the class
    precedence list slot of a class is bound before accessing it.
    (reported by Markus Krummenacker)
  * bug fix: FORMATTER can successfully compile pretty-printer format
    strings which use variants of the ~* directive inside.
  * bug fix: SEARCH now applies its TEST predicate to the elements of
    the arguments in the correct order. (thanks to Wolfhard Buss)
  * fixed bug 235b: The compiler uses return types of MAPCAR and friends
    in type inference. (thanks to Robert E. Brown)
  * bug fix: Reading in symbols with an explicit package name of ""
    (e.g. '||::FOO) now works correctly.  (reported by Henrik Motakef)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** NIL is now allowed as a structure slot name.
    ** Arbitrary numbers, not just REALs, are allowed in certain
       circumstances in LOOP for-as-arithmetic clauses.
    ** Multiple class redefinitions before slot access no longer
       causes a type error.
    ** (SETF FIND-CLASS) now accepts NIL as an argument to remove the
       association between the name and a class.
    ** Generic functions with non-standard method-combination and over
       five methods all of which return constants no longer return NIL
       after the first few invocations. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
    ** CALL-NEXT-METHOD with no arguments now passes the original
       values of the arguments, even in the presence of assignment.
    ** Functions [N]SUBST*, LAST, NRECONC, [N]SUBLIS may return any
       object.
    ** DISASSEMBLE works with closures and funcallable instances.
    ** ADD-METHOD now returns the generic function, not the new method.
    ** FIND-METHOD signals an error if the lengths of the specializers
       is incompatible with the generic function, even if the ERRORP
       argument is true.
    ** TYPE-OF returns recognizeable subtypes of all built-in-types of
       which its argument is a member.
    ** DEFCLASS only redefines the class named by its class-name
       argument if that name is the proper name of the class;
       otherwise, it creates a new class.
    ** SLOT-UNBOUND now correctly initalizes the CELL-ERROR-NAME slot
       of the UNBOUND-SLOT condition to the name of the slot.
    ** (SETF (AREF bv 0) ...) did not work for bit vectors.
    ** SLOT-UNBOUND and SLOT-MISSING now have their return values
       treated by SLOT-BOUNDP, SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and
       SLOT-MAKUNBOUND in the specified fashion.

changes in sbcl-0.8.0 relative to sbcl-0.8alpha.0
  * SBCL now builds using CLISP (version of late April 2003 from CVS) as
    cross-compilation host. As a consequence, we can now bootstrap our
    way up to SBCL starting with a bare gcc toolchain and human-readable
    source code (first the source to CLISP, then the source to SBCL).
  * A contributed module containing a partial implementation of the
    simple-streams interface has been included.  (thanks to Rudi
    Schlatte)
  * A contributed module implementing the RFC1321 Message Digest
    Algorithm, known as MD5, has been included.
  * minor incompatible change: The :NEGATIVE-ZERO-IS-NOT-ZERO feature
    no longer has any effect, as the code controlled by this feature
    has been deleted.  (As far as we know, no-one has ever built using
    this feature, and its semantics were confused in any case).
  * minor incompatible change: As a consequence of making SLOT-EXISTS-P
    work on conditions (as required by the ANSI specification),
    SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and SLOT-BOUNDP likewise have the
    expected behaviour on conditions.  Users should note, however,
    that such behaviour is not required by the ANSI specification,
    and so use of this behaviour may render their code unportable.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** the GENERIC-FUNCTION type is no longer disjoint from FUNCTION
       types.
    ** &ENVIRONMENT parameter in macro lambda list is bound first.
    ** SXHASH on condition objects no longer returns NIL.
    ** :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots are better treated; their values are
       updated on class redefinition, and initforms inherited from
       superclasses are applied.
    ** REMOVE-METHOD returns its generic function argument even when
       no method was removed.
    ** SHARED-INITIALIZE now initializes the values of the requested
       slots, including those with :ALLOCATION :CLASS.
    ** ALLOCATE-INSTANCE now works on structure classes defined via
       DEFSTRUCT (and not just by those from DEFCLASS :METACLASS
       STRUCTURE-CLASS).
    ** SLOT-EXISTS-P now works on conditions, as well as structures
       and CLOS instances.
    ** MAKE-LOAD-FORM now has the required methods on
       STRUCTURE-OBJECT, CONDITION and STANDARD-OBJECT.
    ** MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS no longer returns a special
       keyword, and now implements the SLOT-NAMES argument.
    ** methods with &OPTIONAL arguments no longer allow too many
       arguments to be passed in the call without error.
    ** DEFGENERIC now checks that the :ARGUMENT-PRECEDENCE-ORDER
       option is consistent with the required arguments of the generic
       function lambda list.
  * bug fix: REQUIRE accepts a string designator. (Thanks to
    Antonio Martinez.)
  * bug fix: SB-MOP:DIRECT-SLOT-DEFINITION-CLASS and
    SB-MOP:EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION-CLASS now have the
    specified-by-AMOP lambda list of (CLASS &REST INITARGS).
  * bug fix: The compiler now checks for duplicated variables in macro
    lambda lists.
  * bug fix: SETQ on globals returns the correct value.
  * fixed bug 47.d: (DEFGENERIC IF (X)) now signals a PROGRAM-ERROR,
    not a COMPILER-ERROR (followed by some other strange error on
    choosing the CONTINUE restart).
  * bug fix: make.sh and friends are now more consistent in the way that
    they look for GNU "make".

changes in sbcl-0.8alpha.0 relative to sbcl-0.7.14
  * experimental native threads support (on x86 Linux >=2.4 only).
    This is not compiled in by default: you need to add :SB-THREAD to
    the target features.  See the "Beyond ANSI" chapter of the manual
    for details.
  * fix for longstanding nonANSIism: The old distinction between
    CL:CLASS objects and SB-PCL:CLASS objects has been eliminated.
    The return value from CL:FIND-CLASS is now a CLOS class, and
    likewise that of CL:CLASS-OF; CL:BUILT-IN-CLASS,
    CL:STRUCTURE-CLASS and CL:STANDARD-CLASS name CLOS classes.
  * An interface to the MetaObject Protocol, as described in Kiczales,
    des Rivieres and Bobrow's "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol",
    MIT Press, 1991, is available from the SB-MOP package.
  * incompatible change: the SB-PCL package should now be considered
    a private implementation detail, and no longer a semi-private MOP
    interface.
  * minor incompatible change: due to rearrangement for threads, the
    control stack and binding stack are now allocated at arbitrary
    addresses instead of being hardcoded per-port.  Users affected by
    this probably have to be doing advanced things with shared
    libraries, and will know who they are.
  * minor incompatible change: Previously, all --eval forms used were
    processed with READ before any of them were processed with EVAL.
    Now each --eval form is processed with both READ and EVAL before
    the next --eval form is processed. (Thus package operations like
    sbcl --eval "(defpackage :foo)" --eval "(print 'foo::bar)" now
    work as the user might reasonably expect.)
  * minor incompatible change: *STANDARD-INPUT* is now only an
    INPUT-STREAM, not a BIDIRECTIONAL-STREAM.  (thanks to Antonio
    Martinez)
  * minor incompatible change: Y-OR-N-P is now character-oriented,
    not line oriented.  Also, YES-OR-NO-P now works without errors.
    (thanks to Antonio Martinez)
  * sb-aclrepl module improvements: an integrated inspector, added
    repl features, and a bug fix to :trace command.
  * Known functions, which cannot be open coded by the backend, are
    considered to be able to check types of their arguments. (fixing
    a bug report by Nathan J. Froyd)
  * fixed a bug in computing method discriminating functions: It is
    now possible to define methods specialized on classes which have
    forward-referenced superclasses. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed evaluation order in optional entries (reported by Gilbert
    Baumann)
  * SB-MOP:ENSURE-CLASS-USING-CLASS now takes its arguments in the
    specified-by-AMOP order of (CLASS NAME &REST ARGS &KEY).
  * SB-MOP:COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-SLOT-DEFINITION now takes the
    required-by-AMOP NAME argument, as well as CLASS and
    DIRECT-SLOT-DEFINITIONS.  (thanks to Kevin Rosenberg)
  * fixed bug 20: DEFMETHOD can define methods using names that are
    not the proper names of classes to designate class specializers.
  * bug fix: INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P now works on streams associated with
    Unix file descriptors, instead of blowing up. (thanks to Antonio
    Martinez)
  * Garbage collection refactoring: user-visible change is that a
    call to the GC function during WITHOUT-GCING will not do garbage
    collection until the end of the WITHOUT-GCING.  If you were doing
    this you were probably losing anyway.
  * fixed bug in MEMBER type: (MEMBER 0.0) is not the same as
    (SINGLE-FLOAT 0.0 0.0), because of the existence of -0.0 which is
    TYPEP the latter but not the former.
  * The compiler issues a full WARNING for calls to undefined functions
    with names from the CL package.
  * MAP-INTO for a vector destination is open coded.  (reported by
    Brian Downing on c.l.l)
  * bug fix: the long form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION now accepts a
    documentation string.
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** COPY-ALIST now signals an error if its argument is a dotted
       list.
    ** Condition slots are now accessed more correctly in the presence
       of multiple initargs for a given slot.
    ** The USE-VALUE, CONTINUE and STORE-VALUE functions now correctly
       exclude restarts of the same name associated with a different
       condition.
    ** DEFCLASS of forward-referenced classes with another
       forward-referenced class in the superclasses list no longer
       causes an error.
    ** Condition slots are now initialized once each, not multiple
       times. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
    ** CONVERT-MORE-CALL failed on a lambda list (&KEY). (thanks to
       Gerd Moellmann)
    ** &WHOLE and &REST arguments in macro lambda lists are patterns.
    ** NSET-EXCLUSIVE-OR does not return extra elements when its
       arguments contain duplicated elements.
    ** RESTART-CASE understands local macros.
    ** RESTART-CASE associates exactly its own restarts with a condition.
    ** ENDP in safe mode checks its argument to be of type LIST.
    ** COPY-SYMBOL in a threaded build no longer fails when the symbol
       in question is unbound.
    ** Optimized MAKE-INSTANCE functions no longer cause internal
       assertion failures in the presence of duplicate initargs.
    ** SLOT-MAKUNBOUND returns the instance acted upon, not NIL.
    ** Side-effectful :DEFAULT-INITARGS have their side-effects
       propagated even in the ctor optimized implementation of
       MAKE-INSTANCE.
    ** :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS NIL is now accepted in an initarg list.

changes in sbcl-0.7.14 relative to sbcl-0.7.13:
  * a better implementation of SXHASH on (simple) bit vectors,
    measured both in execution speed and in distribution of results
    over the positive fixnums, has been installed.  Likewise, a better
    implementation of EQUAL for simple bit vectors is now available.
  * fixed CEILING optimization for a divisor of form 2^k.
  * fixed bug 240 (emitting extra style warnings "using the lexical
    binding of the symbol *XXX*" for &OPTIONAL arguments).  (reported
    by Antonio Martinez)
  * fixed SXHASH, giving different results for NIL depending on type
    declarations (SYMBOL or LIST).  (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed bug in DEFPARAMETER and DEFVAR: they could assign a lexical
    variable.  (found by Rolf Wester)
  * SBCL does not ignore type declarations for special
    variables.  (reported by rif on c.l.l 2003-03-05)
  * some bug fixes in contrib/sb-aclrepl/
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** a bug in the CONS type specifier, whereby the CAR and CDR
       types got intertwined, has been fixed;
    ** the type system is now able to reason about the interaction
       between INTEGER and RATIO types more completely;
    ** APPEND, [N]REVERSE and NRECONC check that those their
       arguments, which must be proper lists, are really so;
    ** An array specialized to be unable to hold elements has been
       implemented, as required -- yes, really -- by ANSI;
    ** GETF and GET-PROPERTIES throw a TYPE-ERROR, not a SIMPLE-ERROR,
       on malformed property lists;

changes in sbcl-0.7.13 relative to sbcl-0.7.12:
  * incompatible packaging change: in line with Unix convention,
    SBCL now looks for its core file in /usr/{local/,}lib/sbcl/sbcl.core
    if it's not in $SBCL_HOME.  It also sets SBCL_HOME to match.
  * REQUIRE and PROVIDE are now optionally capable of doing something
    useful. See the documentation string for REQUIRE.
  * infrastructure for a managed SBCL contrib system: contributed
    modules in this release include:
    ** the ASDF system definition facility;
    ** an interface to the BSD Sockets API;
    ** an ACL-like convenience interface to the repl;
       (thanks to Kevin Rosenberg)
    ** an implementation of ROTATE-BYTE, with efficient implementation
       on x86 hardware;
  * fixed a bug in LOG, so that LOG of a rational argument near 1 now
    gives a closer approximation to the right answer than previously.
    (thanks to Raymond Toy)
  * fixed bug 157: TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE and
    UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE now take (ignored, in all situations)
    optional environment arguments, as required by ANSI.
  * fixed bugs in other functions taking environment objects, allowing
    calls with an explicit NIL environment argument to be compiled
    without error.
  * fixed bug 228: primary return values from
    FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION are either NIL or suitable for input to
    COMPILE or FUNCTION.
  * fixed a bug in DEFSTRUCT: predicates for :NAMED structures with
    :TYPE will no longer signal errors on innocuous objects.
  * fixed bug 231b: SETQ is better at respecting type declarations in
    the lexical environment.
  * fixed a bug in DEFCLASS: classes named by symbols with no or
    unprintable packages can now be defined.
  * fixed a bug in RESTART-BIND: The :TEST-FUNCTION option had been
    carelessly renamed to :TEST-FUN.  (thanks to Robert E. Brown)
  * fixed compiler failure related to checking types of functions.
    (reported by Robert E. Brown)
  * the compiler is now much more consistent in its error-checking
    treatment of bounding index arguments to sequence functions: in
    (SAFETY 3) code, errors will be signalled in almost all cases if
    invalid sequence bounding indices are passed to functions defined
    by ANSI to operate on sequences.
  * fixed a bug in the build procedure: documentation of SBCL-specific
    packages is now preserved and available in the final Lisp image.
  * lifted FDEFINITION lookup out of loops in the implementation of
    many list operations.  (thanks to Robert E. Brown)
  * fixed a bug in the reader: the #n# reader macro now works for
    objects of type STANDARD-OBJECT.  (reported by Tony Martinez)
  * the compiler is now aware that SYMBOL-FUNCTION returns a FUNCTION
    and that READ-DELIMITED-LIST returns a LIST.  (thanks to Robert
    E. Brown and Tony Martinez respectively)
  * PCL is now smarter about SLOT-VALUE, (SETF SLOT-VALUE) and
    SLOT-BOUNDP: in particular, it is now able to optimize them much
    better, and is now not vulnerable to having packages renamed.
    Furthermore, a compliance bug has been fixed: SLOT-MISSING is now
    always called when a slot is not present in an instance.  (thanks
    to Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed a bug related to CONCATENATED-STREAMs: PEEK-CHAR will no
    longer signal an error on unreading a character following EOF on
    the previous constituent stream.  (thanks to Tony Martinez)
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** ARRAY-IN-BOUNDS-P now allows arbitrary integers as arguments,
       not just nonnegative fixnums;
    ** the logical bit-array operators such as BIT-AND now accept an
       explicit NIL for their "opt-arg" argument (to indicate a
       freshly-consed result bit-array);
    ** ELT now signals an error on an invalid sequence index in safe
       code;
    ** the type system is now cleverer about negations of numeric
       types, and consequently understands the BIGNUM and RATIO types
       better;
    ** the type system is now cleverer about the interaction between
       INTEGER and RATIO types: while bugs still remain, many more
       cases are accurately computed;
    ** in TYPECASE, OTHERWISE now only introduces an otherwise-clause
       if it is in the last clause;
    ** CONSTANTLY now correctly returns a side-effect-free function in
       all cases;
    ** DECLARE is no longer treated as a special-operator; in
       particular, SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P no longer returns T for DECLARE;
  * incremented fasl file version number due to the change in the
    DEFSTRUCT-SLOT-DESCRIPTION structure.

changes in sbcl-0.7.12 relative to sbcl-0.7.11:
  * minor incompatible change: code processed by the "interpreter" or
    EVAL now has a compilation optimization policy of (DEBUG 2)
    (changed from (DEBUG 1)) to improve debuggability of interactive
    development, and to allow the use of the debug RETURN command in
    such code.
  * an experimental implementation of the RETURN command for the
    debugger has been included.  (thanks to Frederik Kuivinen)
  * fixed bug 62: constraints were not propagated into a loop.
  * fixed bug in embedded calls of SORT (reported and investigated by
    Wolfgang Jenkner).
  * fixed some bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** printing and reading of arrays with some dimensions having
       length 0 (thanks to Gerd Moellmann);
    ** BOA constructor with &AUX argument without a default value does
       not cause a type error;
    ** CONSTANTP now returns true for all self-evaluating objects.

changes in sbcl-0.7.11 relative to sbcl-0.7.10:
  * fixed bug 127: DEFSTRUCT now does not clobber old structure
    accessors that are related by inheritance, as specified in the
    :CONC-NAME section of the specification of DEFSTRUCT.  (thanks to
    Valtteri Vuorikoski)
  * The compiler is now able to inline functions that were defined in
    a complex lexical environment (e.g. inside a MACROLET).
  * fixed bug in DESCRIBE, which now works on rank-0 arrays.  (thanks
    to Lutz Euler)
  * Support for the upcoming FreeBSD-5.0 release has been included.
    (thanks to Dag-Erling Smorgrav)
  * fixed bug 219: DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO no longer has compile-time
    effect when it is not in a toplevel context.
  * fixed bug 222: DEFMETHOD and SYMBOL-MACROLET interactions now
    stand a better chance of being correct.  (thanks to Gerd
    Moellmann)
  * fixed bug in COERCE, which now signals an error on coercing a
    rational to a bounded real type which excludes the expected
    answer.
  * The compiler is now able to derive types more accurately from the
    COERCE and COMPILE functions.
  * fixed bug 223: functional binding is considered to be constant
    only for symbols in the CL package.
  * fixed bug 231: SETQ did not check the type of a variable being set
    (reported by Robert E. Brown)
  * A new optimization for MAKE-INSTANCE has been included, fixing
    various bugs (including relating to :ALLOCATION :CLASS slots and
    :DEFAULT-INITARGS over-eager evalueation).  (thanks to Gerd
    Moellmann)
  * fixed some LOOP bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** As required by ANSI, LOOP now disallows anonymous collection
       clauses such as COLLECT I in conjunction with aggregate boolean
       clauses such as THEREIS (= I 1);
    ** LOOP now signals an error when any variable is reused in the
       same loop (including the potentially useful construct analogous
       to WITH A = 1 WITH A = (1+ A);
    ** IT is only a special loop symbol within the first clause of a
       conditional loop clause;
    ** LOOP with a typed iteration variable over a hashtable now
       signals a type error iff it should.
  * fixed some other bugs revealed by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** FILE-STREAM now names the class previously known as FD-STREAM;
    ** in DEFSTRUCT, a bare :CONC-NAME (or a :CONC-NAME with no
       argument) no longer signals an error;
    ** likewise in DEFSTRUCT, :CONC-NAME NIL now respects the package
       of the slot symbol, rather than using the current package
       ((:CONC-NAME "") continues to intern the slot's name in the
       current package);
  * incremented fasl file version number, because of the incompatible
    change to the DEFSTRUCT-DESCRIPTION structure, and again because
    of the new implementation of DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO.

changes in sbcl-0.7.10 relative to sbcl-0.7.9:
  * Support for building SBCL for MIPS platforms running in
    little-endian mode has now been checked in, and basic
    functionality on said platforms verified.
  * minor incompatible change: PCL now records the pathname of a file
    in which methods and the like are defined, rather than its
    truename.
  * minor incompatible change: TRUENAME now considers the truename of
    a file naming a directory to be the pathname with :DIRECTORY
    component indicating that directory.
  * minor incompatible change: a NAMED clause in the extended form of
    LOOP no longer causes a BLOCK named NIL to surround the LOOP.  The
    reason for the previous behaviour is unclear.
  * more systematization and improvement of CLOS and MOP conformance
    in PCL (thanks to Gerd Moellman and Pierre Mai):
    ** the standard ANSI CL generic function NO-NEXT-METHOD is now
       implemented;
    ** DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION no longer signals an error for
       primary methods with no specializers;
    ** the MOP generic function GENERIC-FUNCTION-DECLARATIONS is now
       implemented;
    ** the Readers for Class Metaobjects methods CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS
       and CLASS-DIRECT-DEFAULT-INITARGS have been implemented for
       FORWARD-REFERENCED-CLASSes; error reporting on
       CLASS-DEFAULT-INITARGS, CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST and CLASS-SLOTS
       has been improved;
    ** SXHASH on CLOS instances now uses a slot internal to the
       instance to return different numbers on distinct instances,
       while preserving the same return value through invocations of
       CHANGE-CLASS;
    ** DEFMETHOD signals errors when methods with longer incongruent
       lambda lists are added to generic functions;
    ** COMPUTE-CLASS-PRECEDENCE-LIST now has a method specialized on
       CLASS, as specified in AMOP;
    ** COMPUTE-SLOTS :AROUND now assigns locations sequentially based
       on the order returned by the primary method for classes of
       class STANDARD-CLASS;
    ** DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION now works with the :ARGUMENTS option.
  * fixed some bugs shown by Paul Dietz' test suite:
    ** DOLIST puts its body in TAGBODY;
    ** SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR sends arguments to :TEST function in the
       correct order;
    ** MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ evaluates side-effectful places before
       value producing form;
    ** if more variables are given to PROGV than values, extra
       variables are bound and made to have no value;
    ** NSUBSTITUTE on list arguments gets the right answer with
       :FROM-END;
    ** ELT signals an error of type TYPE-ERROR when the index argument
       is not a valid sequence index;
    ** LOOP signals (at macroexpansion time) an error of type
       PROGRAM-ERROR when duplicate variable names are found;
    ** LOOP supports DOWNTO and ABOVE properly; (thanks to Matthew Danish)
    ** FUNCALL of special-operators now cause an error of type
       UNDEFINED-FUNCTION;
    ** PSETQ now works as required in the presence of side-effecting
       symbol-macro places;
    ** NCONC accepts any object as its last argument;
    ** :COUNT argument to sequence functions may be BIGNUM; (thanks to
       Gerd Moellman)
    ** loop-for-as-package does not require a package to be explicitely
       specified;
    ** LOOP WITH now treats NIL in the d-var-spec correctly as an
       ignored binding.
  * fixed bug 166: compiler preserves "there is a way to go"
    invariant when deleting code.
  * fixed bug 172: macro lambda lists with required arguments after
    &REST arguments now cause an error to be signalled.  (thanks to
    Matthew Danish)
  * fixed Entomotomy PEEK-CHAR-WRONGLY-ECHOS-TO-ECHO-STREAM
    bug. (thanks to Matthew Danish)
  * fixed bug 225: STRING-STREAM is now a class. (reported by Gilbert
    Baumann)
  * fixed bug 136: CALL-NEXT-METHOD no longer gets confused when
    arguments are lexically rebound. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann and
    Pierre Mai)
  * fixed bug 194: error messages are now more informative when there
    is no primary method applicable in a call to a generic
    function. (thanks to Gerd Moellmann)
  * fixed bug in command line argument checking (thanks to Julian
    Fondren)
  * fixed bug in COUNT-IF, making it handle :FROM-END correctly
    (thanks to Matthew Danish)
  * incremented fasl file version number, because of the
    SXHASH-related changes in the layout of CLOS data structures

changes in sbcl-0.7.9 relative to sbcl-0.7.8:
  * minor incompatible change: The runtime (the Unix executable named
    "sbcl") is now much pickier about the .core files it will load.
    Essentially it now requires .core files to descend from the same
    build (not just the same sources or LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION)
    as the runtime does. (The intent is to prevent the crashes which
    can occur, and which can even be reported as mysterious failures,
    when people patch the sources or change the build parameters
    without changing LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION, then mix and match
    sbcl and .core files.)
  * fixed bug: VALUES-LIST is no longer optimized away.
  * fixed bug 142: The FFI conversion of C string values to Lisp
    string values no longer conses excessively. (thanks to Nathan
    Froyd porting Raymond Toy's fix to CMU CL)
  * began to systematize and improve MOP conformance in PCL (thanks to
    Nathan Froyd, Gerd Moellman and Pierre Mai):
    ** SLOT-DEFINITION-ALLOCATION now returns :CLASS, not the class
       itself;
    ** GENERIC-FUNCTION-ARGUMENT-PRECEDENCE-ORDER is now implemented;
    ** FINALIZE-INHERITANCE is now called on class finalization;
    ** DOCUMENTATION and (SETF DOCUMENTATION) now have the correct
       argument precedence order.
  * fixed bug 202: The compiler no longer fails on functions whose
    derived types contradict their declared type.
  * DEFMACRO is implemented via EVAL-WHEN instead of IR1 translation,
    so it can be non-toplevel.
  * The fasl file version number has changed (because of the new
    implementation of DEFMACRO).
  * (mostly) fixed bugs 46b and 46c: sequence functions now check, in
    safe code, that any length requirement by their type-specifier
    argument is valid.  The exceptions to this are described in bug
    213.
  * fixed bugs 46h and 46i: TWO-WAY- and CONCATENATED-STREAM creation
    functions now check the types of their inputs as required by ANSI.
  * fixed bug 48c: SYMBOL-MACROLET signals PROGRAM-ERROR when an
    introduced symbol is DECLAREd to be SPECIAL.
  * fixed reading of (COMPLEX DOUBLE-FLOAT) literals from fasl files
  * fixed bug: :COUNT argument to sequence functions may be negative
  * fixed bug: body of DO-SYMBOLS may contain declarations
  * fixed bug: PUSHNEW now evaluates its arguments from left to right
    (reported by Paul F. Dietz, fixed by Gerd Moellman)
  * fixed bug: PUSH, PUSHNEW and POP now evaluate a place given by a
    symbol macro only once
  * fixed printing of call frame when argument list is unavailable
  * fixed bug: :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS is an allowed keyword name
  * compiler no longer signals WARNING on unknown keyword
    :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS

changes in sbcl-0.7.8 relative to sbcl-0.7.7:
  * A beta-quality port to the mips architecture running Linux,
    based on the old CMUCL backend, has been made.  It has been tested
    on a big-endian kernel, and works sufficiently well to be able to
    rebuild itself; it has not been tested in little-endian mode.
  * fixed an inconsistency between gencgc.c and purify.c which made
    dumping/loading .core files unreliable
  * fixed bug 120a: The compiler now deals correctly with IFs where
    the consequent is the same as the alternative, instead of
    misderiving the return type. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * fixed bug 113: Logical pathnames are now dumpable (the logical
    host is resolved at load-time, throwing an error if it is not
    found).
  * fixed bug 174: FORMAT's error message is slightly clearer when a
    non-printing character is used in a format directive.
  * fixed several bugs in compiler checking of type declarations, i.e.
    violations of the Python "declarations are assertions" principle
    (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * fixed several bugs in PCL's error checking (thanks to Gerd
    Moellmann)
  * fixed bug: printing of FILE-ERROR (thanks to Antonio
    Martinez-Shotton)
  * fixed bug in compilation of functions as first class values
    (thanks to Antonio Martinez-Shotton)
  * The compiler's handling TYPE-ERRORs which it can prove will
    inevitably happen at runtime has been cleaned up and corrected
    in several ways. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * improved argument type checking for various basic arithmetic
    operations (MAX, +, LOGXOR, etc.) which have had so much TLC
    lavished on them in the past that they can be compiled in many
    ways in different special cases
  * fixed bug 181: compiler checks validity of user supplied type
    specifiers
  * cleaned up code flushing in optimization: Function calls which
    should signal errors for safety purposes (e.g. which ANSI says
    should signal errors when their arguments are of incorrect type)
    are no longer optimized away.
  * added new extension: SB-DEBUG:BACKTRACE-AS-LIST
  * incremented fasl file version number, because changes in the
    implementation of sequence functions like COERCE caused
    internal utility functions like COERCE-TO-SIMPLE-VECTOR (used
    in old inline expansions) to become undefined. (Actually these
    changes were later undone, so we might very well be binary
    compatible with 0.7.7 after all, but leaving the version number
    incremented seemed like the simplest and most conservative
    thing to do.)

changes in sbcl-0.7.7 relative to sbcl-0.7.6:
  * An alpha-quality port to the parisc architecture running Linux,
    based on the old CMUCL backend, has been made.  This, even more so
    than the other backends, should be considered still a work in
    progress; known problems include that the Linux kernel in 64-bit
    mode does not propagate the correct sigcontext structure to
    userspace, and consequently SBCL on a parisc64 kernel will not
    work yet.
  * fixed bug 189: The compiler now respects NOTINLINE declarations for
    functions declared in FLET and LABELS. (I.e. "LET conversion" is
    suppressed.) Also now that the compiler is looking at declarations
    in the environment, it checks optimization declarations as well,
    and suppresses inlining when (> DEBUG SPEED).
  * More fixes have been made to treatment of floating point exception
    treatment and other Unix signals.  In particular, floating point
    exceptions no longer cause Bus errors on the SPARC/Linux platform.
  * The detection and handling of control stack exhaustion (infinite
    or very deeply nested recursion) has changed.  Stack exhaustion
    detection is now done by write-protecting pages at the OS level
    and applies at all optimization settings; when found, a
    SB-KERNEL:CONTROL-STACK-EXHAUSTED condition (subclass of
    STORAGE-CONDITION) is signalled, so stack exhaustion can no longer
    be caught using IGNORE-ERRORS.
  * Bugs 65, 70, and 109 fixed: The compiler now preserves invariants
    correctly when transforming recursive LABELS functions to LETs.
    (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * Bug 48a./b. fixed: SYMBOL-MACROLET now refuses to bind symbols
    that are names of constants or global variables.
  * Bug fix: DEFINE-ALIEN-ROUTINE now declaims the correct FTYPE for
    alien routines with docstrings.
  * Bug 184 fixed: Division of ratios by the integer 0 now signals an
    error of type DIVISION-BY-ZERO. (thanks to Wolfhard Buss and
    Raymond Toy)
  * Bug fix: Errors in PARSE-INTEGER are now of type PARSE-ERROR.
    (thanks to Eric Marsden)
  * Bug fix: COERCE to (COMPLEX FLOAT) of rationals now returns an
    object of type (COMPLEX FLOAT). (thanks to Wolfhard Buss)
  * Bug fix: The SPARC backend can now compile functions involving
    LOGAND and stack-allocated arguments. (thanks to Raymond Toy)
  * Bug fix: We no longer segfault on passing a non-FILE-STREAM stream
    to a functions expecting a PATHNAME-DESIGNATOR.
  * Bug fix: DEFGENERIC now enforces the ANSI restrictions on its
    lambda lists. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * Bug fix: changed encoding of PCL's internal MAKE-INSTANCE
    functions so that EXPORTing the name of the class doesn't cause
    MAKE-INSTANCE functions from earlier DEFCLASSes to get lost (thanks
    to Antonio Martinez for reporting this)
  * Bug 192 fixed: The internal primitive DATA-VECTOR-REF can now be
    constant-folded without failing an assertion. (thanks to Einar
    Floystad Dorum for reporting this)
  * Bugs 123 and 165 fixed: array specializations on as-yet-undefined
    types are now dealt with more correctly by the compiler.
  * Minor incompatible change: COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME now merges its
    OUTPUT-FILE argument with its INPUT-FILE argument, resulting in
    behaviour analogous to RENAME-FILE.  This puts its behaviour more
    in line with ANSI's wording on COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME. (thanks to
    Marco Antinotti)
  * The fasl file version number has changed again. (because of the
    bug fix involving the names of PCL MAKE-INSTANCE functions)

changes in sbcl-0.7.6 relative to sbcl-0.7.5:
  * bug fix: Floating point exceptions are treated much more
    consistently on the x86/Linux and PPC/Linux platforms.
  * Array initialization with :INITIAL-ELEMENT is now much faster for
    cases when the compiler cannot open code the array creation, but
    does know what the UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE will be. General
    array accesses have also seen a speed increase.
  * bug fix: LOAD :IF-DOES-NOT-EXIST NIL now works when file type is
    specified. (This was at the root of some bad interactions between
    SBCL and ILISP: thanks to Gregory Wright for diagnosing this and
    reporting the bug.)
  * bug fix: Internal error arguments for undefined functions are now
    computed correctly on the PPC/Linux platform.
  * bug fix: Bad &REST syntax is now checked correctly. (thanks to
    Raymond Toy's patch for CMU CL)
  * Support for the Solaris 9 operating environment has been included
    (thanks to Daniel Merritt)
  * A very ugly but hopefully complete draft of the missing FFI chapter
    of the manual has been created by reformatting the corresponding
    CMU CL manual chapter into (currently very ugly and incoherent)
    DocBook and bringing it up to date for SBCL behavior. Thus, the
    manual is now essentially complete, at least by my extreme
    once-and-only-once standards, whereby it's acceptable to refer to
    the doc strings of SB-EXT functions as the primary documentation.
  * The fasl file version number has changed again, due to cleanup of
    (user-invisible) bitrotted stuff. (E.g. *!INITIAL-FDEFN-OBJECTS*
    is no longer a static symbol.)

changes in sbcl-0.7.5 relative to sbcl-0.7.4:
  * SBCL now builds with OpenMCL (version 0.12) as the
    cross-compilation host; also, more progress has been made toward
    bootstrapping under CLISP.
  * SBCL now runs on the Tru64 (aka OSF/1) operating system on the
    Alpha architecture.
  * bug 158 fixed: The compiler can now deal with integer loop
    increments different from 1; fixing this turned out also to fix
    bug 164.
  * bug 169 fixed: no more bogus warnings about using lexical bindings
    despite the presence of perfectly good SPECIAL declarations (thanks
    to David Lichteblau)
  * bug 175 fixed: CHANGE-CLASS is now more ANSI-conforming,
    accepting initargs. (thanks to Espen Johnsen and Pierre Mai)
  * bug 179 fixed: DIRECTORY can now deal with filenames with pattern
    characters in them.
  * bug 180 fixed: Method combination specifications no longer ignore
    the :MOST-SPECIFIC-LAST option. (thanks to Pierre Mai)
  * bug fix: Structure type predicate functions now check their argument
    count as they should.
  * bug fix: Classes with :METACLASS STRUCTURE-CLASS now print
    correctly. (thanks to Pierre Mai)
  * minor incompatible change: The --noprogrammer option is deprecated
    in favor of the new --disable-debugger option, which is very similar.
    (The major difference is that it takes effect at a slightly different
    time at startup, causing handling of errors in --sysinit and
    --userinit files will be affected differently.) The
    SB-EXT:DISABLE-DEBUGGER and SB-EXT:ENABLE-DEBUGGER functions have
    been added to allow this functionality to be controlled from ordinary
    Lisp code. (ENABLE-DEBUGGER should help people like the Debian
    maintainers, who might want to run non-interactive scripts to
    build SBCL cores which will later be used interactively.)
  * minor incompatible change: The LOAD function no longer, when given
    a wild pathname to load, loads all files matching that pathname.
    Instead, an error of type FILE-ERROR is signalled.

changes in sbcl-0.7.4 relative to sbcl-0.7.3:
  * bug 147 fixed: The compiler preserves its block link/count
    invariants more correctly now so that it doesn't crash. (thanks
    to Alexey Dejneka)
  * Dynamic loading of object files in OpenBSD is now supported. (thanks
    to Pierre Mai)
  * COMPILE now works correctly on macros. (thanks to Matthias Hoelzl)
  * GET-MACRO-CHARACTER and SET-MACRO-CHARACTER now represent
    no-value-for-this-character as NIL (as specified by ANSI).
  * HOST-NAMESTRING on physical pathnames now returns a string that is
    valid as a host argument to MERGE-PATHNAMES and to MAKE-PATHNAME.
    (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)
  * The Alpha port handles icache flushing more correctly. (thanks to
    Dan Barlow)
  * More progress has been made toward bootstrapping under CLISP. (thanks
    to Christophe Rhodes)
  * The fasl file format has changed again, because dynamic loading
    on OpenBSD (which has non-ELF object files) motivated some cleanups
    in the way that foreign symbols are transformed and passed around.
  * minor incompatible change: The ASCII RUBOUT character, (CHAR-CODE 127),
    is no longer treated as whitespace by the reader, but instead as
    an ordinary character. Thus e.g. (READ-FROM-STRING "AB") returns
    |AB|, instead of A as it used to.

changes in sbcl-0.7.3 relative to sbcl-0.7.2:
  * ANSI's DEFINE-SYMBOL-MACRO is now supported. (thanks to Nathan
    Froyd porting CMU CL code originally by Douglas Thomas Crosher)
  * SBCL now runs on the PPC archtiecture under Linux. It actually did
    this as of 0.7.1.45, but was left out of the previous news section
    (thanks to Dan Barlow)
  * SBCL now runs on the Solaris operating system on SPARC architectures
    (thanks to Christophe Rhodes's port of the CMUCL runtime)
  * cleanups to the runtime on SPARC, both Linux and Solaris, and for
    gcc>=3 (thanks to Nathan Froyd and Ingvar Mattsson)
  * SPARC backend cleanups, allowing builds of cores optimized for V8
    and V9 SPARCS, and also emission of code targeted to a particular
    backend chosen at runtime (thanks to Christophe Rhodes and Raymond
    Toy)
  * SBCL is closer to bootstrapping under CLISP, thanks to various
    fixes by Christophe Rhodes.
  * The fasl file format has changed again, to allow the compiler's
    INFO database to support symbol macros.
  * The user manual (in doc/) is formatted into HTML more nicely.
    (thanks to coreythomas)
  * The system is smarter about SUBTYPEP relationships, especially
    those involving NOT types (including types such as ATOM which are
    represented internally using NOT types). Thus SUBTYPEP is less
    likely to return (VALUES NIL NIL) in general, and in particular
    bugs 58 and (the remaining bits of) bug 50 are fixed. (thanks to
    Christophe Rhodes)
  * The fasl file format has changed again, because the internal
    representation of types now includes a new slot to support the new
    SUBTYPEP-of-NOT-types logic.
  * (not a change in the main branch of SBCL, but a related prototype
    which can hopefully be merged into the main branch of SBCL in the
    future:) Brian Spilsbury has produced a Unicode-enabled variant of
    sbcl-0.7.0, available as a patch against sbcl-0.7.0 at
      <http://designix.com.au/brian/SBCL/sbcl-0.7.0-unicode.p0.gz>.
  * Bug 151 fixed: GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHAR now returns NIL for undefined
    dispatch macro character combinations. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  * Bugfix in PARSE-NAMESTRING: we now correctly parse unix namestrings
    that superficially look like logical namestrings correctly.
  * USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME now returns a (physical) pathname that SBCL
    can deal with.
  * Bugfix in DEFSTRUCT: BOA constructor lambda lists now accept (name
    default supplied-p) for &optional and &key arguments. (thanks to
    Martin Atzmueller)

changes in sbcl-0.7.2 relative to sbcl-0.7.1:
  * incompatible change: The compiler is now less aggressive about
    tail call optimization, doing it only when (> SPACE DEBUG) or
    (> SPEED DEBUG). (This is an incompatible change because there are
    programs which relied on the old CMU-CL-style behavior to optimize
    away their unbounded recursion which will now die of stack overflow.)
  * minor incompatible change: The default BYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS
    for non-GENCGC systems has been increased to 20M (since that
    seems much closer to the likely performance optimum for modern
    systems than the old 4M value was)
  * minor incompatible change: new larger values for *DEBUG-PRINT-LENGTH*
    and *DEBUG-PRINT-LEVEL*
  * SBCL runs on SPARC systems now. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes' port
    of CMU CL's support for SPARC, and various endianness and other
    SBCL portability fixes due to Christophe Rhodes and Dan Barlow)
  * new syntactic sugar for the Unix command line: --load foo.bar is now
    an alternate notation for --eval '(load "foo.bar")'.
  * bug fixes:
    ** The system now detects stack overflow and handles it gracefully,
       at least for (OR (> SAFETY (MAX SPEED SPACE)) (= SAFETY 3))
       optimization settings. (This is a good thing in general, and
       its introduction in this version should be particularly timely
       for anyone whose code fails because of suppression of tail
       recursion!)
    ** The system now hunts for the C variable "environ" in a more
       devious way, to avoid segfaults when the C library version differs
       between compile time and run time. (thanks to Christophe Rhodes)
    ** INTEGER-valued CATCH tags now work. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka,
       and also to Christophe Rhodes for porting the fix to non-X86 CPUs)
    ** The compiler no longer issues bogus style warnings for undefined
       classes in the same source file as the DEFCLASSes which defined
       them. (thanks to Stig E Sandoe for reporting and Martin Atzmueller
       for fixing this)
    ** fixes in CONDITION class precedence list for undefined function
       errors (thanks to Alexei Dejneka)
    ** *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* is used more consistently and
       correctly. (thanks to Dan Barlow)
    ** portability fixes aiming at bootstrapping under CLISP (thanks
       to Dave McDonald and Christophe Rhodes)
    ** FORMAT fixes (thanks to Robert Strandh and Dan Barlow)
    ** fixes in type translation and and type inference (thanks to
       Christophe Rhodes)
    ** fixes to optimizer internal errors (thanks to Alexei Dejneka)
    ** various fixes in the new ports (thanks to Dan Barlow)
  * several changes related to debugging:
    ** suppression of tail recursion, as noted above
    ** stack overflow detection, as noted above
    ** The default implementation of TRACE has changed. :ENCAPSULATE T
       is now the default. (For some time encapsulation has been more
       reliable than the breakpoint-based :ENCAPSULATE NIL
       implementation, at least on X86 systems; and I just noticed that
       encapsulation also seems closer to the spirit of the ANSI
       specification.)

changes in sbcl-0.7.1 relative to sbcl-0.7.0:
* mostly bug fixes:
  ** SB-ALIEN:LOAD-FOREIGN and SB-ALIEN:LOAD-1-FOREIGN are set
     up properly again. (There was a packaging bug in 0.7.0 which
     left their definitions in SB-SYS::LOAD-FOREIGN and
     SB-SYS::LOAD-1-FOREIGN. LOAD-FOREIGN and LOAD-1-FOREIGN are
     vital for most things which interface to C-level interfaces,
     like extensions working with sockets or databases or
     Perl-compatible regexes or whatever, and the need to fix
     this bug is the main reason that 0.7.1 was released so
     soon after 0.7.0.)
  ** DEFGENERIC is now choosier about the methods it redefines, so that
     reLOADing a previously-LOADed file containing DEFGENERICs does
     the right thing now. Thus, the Lispy edit/reLOAD-a-little/test
     cycle now works as it should. (thanks to Alexey Dejneka)
  ** Bug 106 (types (COMPLEX FOO) where FOO is an obscure type) was
     fixed by Christophe Rhodes. (He actually submitted this patch
     months ago, and I delayed until after 0.7.0.)
  ** Bug 111 (internal compiler confusion about runtime checks on
     FUNCTION types) was fixed by Alexey Dejneka.
* Some internal cleanups (getting rid of variables which aren't
  needed now that the byte interpreter is gone) caused the fasl
  file format number to change again.

changes in sbcl-0.7.0 relative to sbcl-0.6.13:
* major incompatible change: The default fasl file extension, i.e. the
  default extension for files produced by COMPILE-FILE, has changed
  to ".fasl", for all architectures. (No longer ".x86f" and ".axpf".)
* compiler changes:
  ** There are many changes in the implementation of the compiler.
     SBCL is now essentially a compiler-only implementation of ANSI
     Common Lisp. EVAL still "interprets" a few special cases, but
     almost all the interesting cases are handled by creating
     a LAMBDA expression, calling COMPILE on it, then calling
     FUNCALL on the result.
  ** The EVAL-WHEN code has been rewritten to be ANSI-compliant, and
     various related bugs (IR1-1, IR1-2, IR1-3, IR1-3a) have gone away.
     Since the code is newer, there might still be some new bugs
     (though not as many as before Martin Atzmueller's fixes:-). But
     the new code is substantially simpler and clearer, and hopefully
     any remaining bugs will be simpler, less fundamental, and more
     fixable then the bugs in the old code.
  ** The revised compiler is still a little unsteady on its feet.
     In particular,
     *** The debugging information it produces (particularly the names
         of FUNCTION objects) is sometimes much less useful than what
         the old compiler produced.
     *** The support for inlining FOO when you (DECLAIM (INLINE FOO))
         then do (DEFUN FOO ..) in a non-null lexical environment (e.g.
         within a MACROLET) has been temporarily weakened.
  ** There are new compiler optimizations for various functions:
     *** the sequence functions FIND, POSITION, FIND-IF, POSITION-IF,
         FIND-IF-NOT, POSITION-IF-NOT, and FILL
     *** the math functions TRUNCATE, FLOOR, and CEILING
     *** the function-of-all-trades COERCE
     Mostly these should be transparent, but there's one
     potentially-annoying problem (bug 117): when the compiler
     inline-expands a function and does type analysis on the result,
     it can create control paths which have type mismatches, and
     when it can't prove that those control paths aren't taken,
     it will issue WARNINGs about the type mismatches. This is
     a particular problem in practice for the new sequence functions.
     It's not clear how this should be fixed, and for now, a
     workaround is given in the entry for 117 in the BUGS file.
  ** (Because of the interaction between the two previous items --
     occasional inlining problems and new inline expansions -- some
     of the new sequence function optimizations won't really kick in
     completely until debugging information, and then inlining, are
     straightened out in some future version.)
* minor incompatible changes:
  ** As part of a bug fix by Christophe Rhodes to DIRECTORY behavior,
     DIRECTORY no longer implicitly promotes NIL slots of its
     pathname argument to :WILD. In particular, when you ask for the
     contents of a directory (which you used to be able to do without
     explicit wildcards, e.g. (DIRECTORY "/tmp/")) you now need to use
     explicit wildcards, e.g. (DIRECTORY "/tmp/*.*").
  ** changes in behavior that ANSI explicitly defines to be
     implementation dependent:
     *** The new compiler-only implementation still conforms with ANSI,
         but acts a little different than before. Besides the obvious
	 changes in performance tradeoffs (that the cost per form passed
	 to EVAL has gone up, and the cost per form executed by EVAL
	 has gone down), the behavior of the system changes a little
	 because there are no longer any interpreted function objects.
         COMPILED-FUNCTION-P is now synonymous with FUNCTIONP, and
         e.g. doing COMPILE on the output of interactive DEFUN is
         now a no-op.
     *** The value of INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND has been increased
         from 100 to 1000.
     *** The default for the USE list in MAKE-PACKAGE and DEFPACKAGE
         has changed from (:CL) to NIL.
     *** The CHAR-NAME of unprintable ASCII characters which, unlike
         e.g. #\Newline and #\Tab, don't have names specified in the
         ANSI Common Lisp standard, is now based on their ASCII symbolic
         names (#\Nul, #\Soh, #\Stx, etc.) The old CMU-CL-style names
         (#\Null, #\^a, #\^b, etc.) are still accepted by NAME-CHAR, but
         are no longer used for output.
  ** changes in internal implementation constants:
     *** The default value of *BYTES-CONSED-BETWEEN-GCS* has doubled, to
         4 million. (If your application spends a lot of time GCing and
         you have a lot of RAM, you might want to experiment with
         increasing it even more.)
  ** The SB-C-CALL package has been merged into the SB-ALIEN package.
     However, almost all old code should still continue to work without
     immediate update, as SB-C-CALL is now a (deprecated) nickname
     for SB-ALIEN.
  ** Old operator names in the style DEF-FOO are now deprecated in
     favor of new corresponding names DEFINE-FOO, for consistency with
     the naming convention used in the ANSI standard (DEFSTRUCT, DEFVAR,
     DEFINE-CONDITION, DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO..). This mostly affects
     internal symbols, but a few supported extensions like
     SB-ALIEN:DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION are also affected. (So e.g.
     DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION becomes DEFINE-ALIEN-FUNCTION.)
  ** The debugger prompt sequence now goes "5]", "5[2]", "5[3]",
     etc. as you get deeper into recursive calls to the debugger
     command loop, instead of the old "5]", "5]]", "5]]]"
     sequence. (I was motivated to do this when squabbles between
     ILISP and SBCL left me very deeply nested in the debugger. In the
     short term, this change will probably provoke more ILISP/SBCL
     squabbles, but hopefully it will be an improvement in the long run.)
  ** SB-ALIEN:DEFINE-ALIEN-FUNCTION (also known by the old deprecated
     name DEF-ALIEN-FUNCTION) now does DECLAIM FTYPE for the defined
     function, since declaiming return types involving aliens is
     (1) annoyingly messy to do by hand and (2) vital to efficient
     compilation of code which calls such functions.
  ** SB-ALIEN:LOAD-FOREIGN and SB-ALIEN:LOAD-1-FOREIGN are no
     longer reexported by the SB-EXT package. They're solely useful
     for alien code, so it seems more logical that you should get
     them from the SB-ALIEN package, not in SB-EXT.
  ** :SB-CONSTRAIN-FLOAT-TYPE, :SB-PROPAGATE-FLOAT-TYPE, and
     :SB-PROPAGATE-FUN-TYPE are no longer considered to be optional
     features. Instead, the code that they used to control is always
     built into the system.
* many other bug fixes
  ** DEFSTRUCT and DEFCLASS have been substantially updated to take
     advantage of the new EVAL-WHEN stuff and to clean them up in
     general, and they are now more ANSI-compliant in a number of
     ways. Martin Atzmueller is responsible for a lot of this.
  ** Besides the cleanups discussed above, Martin Atzmueller fixed
     several other bugs:
     *** fixes in READ-SEQUENCE and WRITE-SEQUENCE
     *** correct ERROR type for various file operations
     *** some fixes for Lisp streams
     *** DEFMETHOD syntax checking
     *** changing old weird representation of debug information as
         strings (which, among their other deficiencies, don't transform
         correctly when you rename packages, and don't change their
         print representation when you change things like *PACKAGE*
	 and *PRINT-LENGTH*) to symbols and lists of symbols
     He also made several improvements and fixed several bugs in DESCRIBE.
  ** Alexey Dejneka fixed many bugs, including classic bugs and bugs he
     discovered himself:
     *** misbehavior of WRITE-STRING/WRITE-LINE
     *** LOOP over keys of a hash table, LOOP bugs 49b and 81 and 103,
         and several other LOOP problems as well
     *** DIRECTORY when similar filenames are present
     *** DEFGENERIC with :METHOD options
     *** bug 126, in (MAKE-STRING N :INITIAL-ELEMENT #\SPACE))
     *** bug in the optimization of ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE
     *** argument ordering in FIND with :TEST option
     *** mishandled package designator argument in APROPOS-LIST
     *** various problems in the backquote readmacro
     *** a bug in APROPOS
     *** probably some others that I'm not describing very well here,
         since the CVS log documents them by reference to sbcl-devel
         messages, and the SourceForge archives aren't working well.:-(
  ** Dan Barlow improved the Alpha port (and is making progress on the
     PPC port, for those of you who think different).
  ** Besides the DIRECTORY fixes and changes mentioned elsewhere,
     Christophe Rhodes cleaned up the system self-test scripts (in tests/*),
     contributed the optimization of FIND-IF-NOT and POSITION-IF-NOT, and
     continues to work on the SPARC port (for those of you in a position
     to look down upon our little PC-compatible boxes from a great height).
  ** PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK now copies the *PRINT-LINES* value on entry
     and uses that copy, rather than the current dynamic value, when
     it's trying to decide whether to truncate output. Thus e.g.
       (let ((*print-lines* 50))
         (pprint-logical-block (stream nil)
           (dotimes (i 10)
             (let ((*print-lines* 8))
               (print (aref possiblybigthings i) stream)))))
     should now truncate the logical block only at 50 lines, instead of
     often truncating it at 8 lines, as it did before.
* The doc/cmucl/ directory, containing old CMU CL documentation
  from the time of the fork, is no longer part of the base system.
  SourceForge has shut down its anonymous FTP service, and with it
  my original plan for distributing the old CMU CL documentation
  there. For now, if you need these files you can download an old
  SBCL source release and extract them from it.
* The fasl file version number changed again, for dozens of reasons,
  some of which are apparent above.

changes in sbcl-0.6.13 relative to sbcl-0.6.12:
* a port to the Compaq/DEC Alpha CPU, thanks to Dan Barlow
* Martin Atzmueller ported Tim Moore's marvellous CMU CL DISASSEMBLE
  patch, so that DISASSEMBLE output is much nicer.
* The code in the SB-PROFILE package now seems reasonably stable.
  I still haven't decided what the final interface should look like
  (I'd like PROFILE to interact cleanly with TRACE, since both
  facilities use function encapsulation) but if you have a need
  for profiling now, you can probably use it successfully with
  the current CMU-CL-style interface.
* Pathnames and *DEFAULT-DIRECTORY-DEFAULTS* are much more
  ANSI-compliant, thanks to various fixes and tests from Dan Barlow.
  Also, at Dan Barlow's suggestion, TRUENAME on a dangling symbolic
  link now returns the dangling link itself, and for similar
  reasons, TRUENAME on a cyclic symbolic link returns the cyclic
  link itself. (In these cases the old code signalled an error and
  looped endlessly, respectively.) Thus, DIRECTORY now works even
  in the presence of dangling and cyclic symbolic links.
* Compiler trace output (the :TRACE-FILE option to COMPILE-FILE)
  is now a supported extension again, since the consensus on
  sbcl-devel was that it can be useful for ordinary development
  work, not just for debugging SBCL itself.
* The default for SB-EXT:*DERIVE-FUNCTION-TYPES* has changed to
  NIL, i.e. ANSI behavior, i.e. the compiler now recognizes
  that currently-defined functions might be redefined later with
  different return types.
* Hash tables can be printed readably, as inspired by CMU CL code
  of Eric Marsden and SBCL code of Martin Atzmueller.
* better error handling in CLOS method combination, thanks to
  Martin Atzmueller porting Pierre Mai's CMU CL patches
* more overflow fixes for >16Mbyte I/O buffers
* A bug in READ has been fixed, so that now a single Ctrl-D
  character suffices to cause end-of-file on character streams.
  In particular, now you only need one Ctrl-D at the command
  line (not two) to exit SBCL.
* fixed bug 26: ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT now returns (VALUES NIL 0) for
  undisplaced arrays.
* fixed bug 107 (reported as a CMU CL bug by Erik Naggum on
  comp.lang.lisp 2001-06-11): (WRITE #*101 :RADIX T :BASE 36) now
  does the right thing.
* The implementation of some type tests, especially for CONDITION
  types, is now tidier and maybe faster, due to CMU CL code
  originally by Douglas Crosher, ported by Martin Atzmueller.
* Some math functions have been fixed, and there are new
  optimizers for deriving the types of COERCE and ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE,
  thanks to Raymond Toy's work on CMU CL, ported by Martin Atzmueller.
* (There are also some new optimizers in contrib/*-extras.lisp. Those
  aren't built into sbcl-0.6.13, but are a sneak preview of what's
  likely to be built into sbcl-0.7.0.)
* A bug in COPY-READTABLE was fixed. (Joao Cachopo's patch to CMU
  CL, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller)
* DESCRIBE now gives more information in some cases. (Pierre Mai's
  patch to CMU CL, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller)
* Martin Atzmueller and Bill Newman fixed some bugs in INSPECT.
* There's a new slam.sh hack to shorten the edit/compile/debug
  cycle for low-level changes to SBCL itself, and a new
  :SB-AFTER-XC-CORE target feature to control the generation of
  the after-xc.core file needed by slam.sh.
* minor incompatible change: The ENTRY-POINTS &KEY argument to
  COMPILE-FILE is no longer supported, so that now every function
  gets an entry point, so that block compilation looks a little
  more like the plain vanilla ANSI section 3.2.2.3 scheme.
* minor incompatible change: SB-EXT:GET-BYTES-CONSED now
  returns the number of bytes consed since the system started,
  rather than the number consed since the first time the function
  was called. (The new definition parallels ANSI functions like
  CL:GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME.)
* minor incompatible change: The old CMU-CL-style DIRECTORY options,
  i.e. :ALL, :FOLLOW-LINKS, and :CHECK-FOR-SUBDIRS, are no longer
  supported. Now DIRECTORY always does the abstract Common-Lisp-y
  thing, i.e. :ALL T :FOLLOW-LINKS T :CHECK-FOR-SUBDIRS T.
* Fasl file version numbers are now independent of the target CPU,
  since historically most system changes which required version
  number changes have affected all CPUs equally. Similarly,
  the byte fasl file version is now equal to the ordinary
  fasl file version.

changes in sbcl-0.6.12 relative to sbcl-0.6.11:
* incompatible change: The old SB-EXT:OPTIMIZE-INTERFACE declaration
  is no longer recognized. I apologize for this, because it was
  listed in SB-EXT as a supported extension, but I found that
  its existing behavior was poorly specified, as well as incorrectly
  specified, and it looked like too much of a mess to straighten it
  out. I have enough on my hands trying to get ANSI stuff to work..
* many patches ported from CMU CL by Martin Atzmueller, with
  half a dozen bug fixes in pretty-printing and the debugger, and
  half a dozen others elsewhere
* fixed bug 13: Floating point infinities are now supported again.
  They might still be a little bit flaky, but thanks to bug reports
  from Nathan Froyd and CMU CL patches from Raymond Toy they're not
  as flaky as they were.
* The --noprogrammer command line option is now supported. (Its
  behavior is slightly different in detail from what the old man
  page claimed it would do, but it's still appropriate under the
  same circumstances that the man page talks about.)
* The :SB-PROPAGATE-FLOAT-TYPE and :SB-PROPAGATE-FUN-TYPE features
  are now supported, and enabled by default. Thus, the compiler can
  handle many floating point and complex operations much less
  inefficiently. (Thus e.g. you can implement a complex FFT
  without consing!)
* The compiler now detects type mismatches between DECLAIM FTYPE
  and DEFUN better, and implements CHECK-TYPE more correctly, and
  SBCL builds under CMU CL again despite its non-ANSI EVAL-WHEN,
  thanks to patches from Martin Atzmueller.
* various fixes to make the cross-compiler more portable to
  ANSI-conforming-but-different cross-compilation hosts (notably
  Lispworks for Windows, following bug reports from Arthur Lemmens)
* A bug in READ-SEQUENCE for CONCATENATED-STREAM, and a gross
  ANSI noncompliance in DEFMACRO &KEY argument parsing, have been
  fixed thanks to Pierre Mai's CMU CL patches.
* fixes to keep the system from overflowing internal counters when
  it tries to use i/o buffers larger than 16M bytes
* fixed bug 45a: Various internal functions required to support
  complex special functions have been merged from CMU CL sources.
  (When I was first setting up SBCL, I misunderstood a compile-time
  conditional #-OLD-SPECFUN, and so accidentally deleted them.)
* improved support for type intersection and union, fixing bug 12
  (e.g., now (SUBTYPEP 'KEYWORD 'SYMBOL)=>T,T) and some other
  more obscure bugs as well
* some steps toward byte-compiling non-performance-critical
  parts of the system, courtesy of patches from Martin Atzmueller
* Christophe Rhodes has made some debian packages of sbcl at
  <http://www-jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/ftp/pub/debian/lisp>.
  From his sbcl-devel e-mail of 2001-04-08 they're not completely
  stable, but are nonetheless usable. When he's ready, I'd be happy
  to add them to the SourceForge "File Releases" section. (And if
  anyone wants to do RPMs or *BSD packages, they'd be welcome too.)
* new fasl file format version number (because of changes in
  internal representation of (OR ..) types to accommodate the new
  support for (AND ..) types, among other things)

changes in sbcl-0.6.11 relative to sbcl-0.6.10:
* Martin Atzmueller pointed out that bugs #9 and #25 are gone in
  current SBCL.
* bug 34 fixed by Martin Atzmueller: dumping/loading instances works
  better
* fixed bug 40: TYPEP, SUBTYPEP, UPGRADED-ARRAY-ELEMENT-TYPE,
  and UPGRADED-COMPLEX-PART-TYPE now work better with of compound
  types built from undefined types, e.g. '(VECTOR SOME-UNDEF-TYPE).
* DESCRIBE now works on structure objects again.
* Most function call argument type mismatches are now handled as
  STYLE-WARNINGs instead of full WARNINGs, since the compiler doesn't
  know whether the function will be redefined before the call is
  executed. (The compiler could flag local calls with full WARNINGs,
  as per the ANSI spec "3.2.2.3 Semantic Constraints", but right now
  it doesn't keep track of enough information to know whether calls
  are local in this sense.)
* Compiler output is now more verbose, with messages truncated
  later than before. (There should be some supported way for users
  to override the default verbosity, but I haven't decided how to
  provide it yet, so this behavior is still controlled by the internal
  SB-C::*COMPILER-ERROR-PRINT-FOO* variables in
  src/compiler/ir1util.lisp.)
* Fasl file format version numbers have increased again, because
  support for the Gray streams extension changes the layout of the
  system's STREAM objects.
* The Gray subclassable streams extension now works, thanks to a
  patch from Martin Atzmueller.
* The full LOAD-FOREIGN extension (not just the primitive
  LOAD-FOREIGN-1) now works, thanks to a patch from Martin Atzmueller.
* The default behavior of RUN-PROGRAM has changed. Now, unlike CMU CL
  but like most other programs, it defaults to copying the Unix
  environment from the original process instead of starting the
  new process in an empty environment.
* Extensions which manipulate the Unix environment now support
  an :ENVIRONMENT keyword option which doesn't smash case or
  do other bad things. The CMU-CL-style :ENV option is retained
  for porting convenience.
* LOAD-FOREIGN (and LOAD-1-FOREIGN) now support logical pathnames,
  as per Daniel Barlow's suggestion and Martin Atzmueller's patch

changes in sbcl-0.6.10 relative to sbcl-0.6.9:

* A patch from Martin Atzmueller seems to have solved the SIGINT
  problem, and as far as we know, signal-handling now works cleanly.
  (If you find any new bugs, please report them!)
* The system no longer defaults Lisp source file names to types
  ".l", ".cl", or ".lsp", but only to ".lisp".
* The compiler no longer uses special default file extensions for
  byte-compiled code. (The ANSI definition of COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME
  seems to expect a single default extension for all compiled code,
  and there's no compelling reason to try to stretch the standard
  to allow two different extensions.) Instead, byte-compiled files
  default to the same extension as native-compiled files.
* Fasl file format version numbers have increased again, because
  a rearrangement of internal implementation packages made some
  dumped symbols in old fasl files unreadable in new cores.
* DECLARE/DECLAIM/PROCLAIM logic is more nearly ANSI in general, with
  many fewer weird special cases.
* Bug #17 (differing COMPILE-FILE behavior between logical and
  physical pathnames) has been fixed, and some related misbehavior too,
  thanks to a patch from Martin Atzmueller.
* Bug #30 (reader problems) is gone, thanks to a CMU CL patch
  by Tim Moore, ported to SBCL by Martin Atzmueller.
* Martin Atzmueller fixed several filesystem-related problems,
  including bug #36, in part by porting CMU CL patches, which were
  written in part by Paul Werkowski.
* More compiler warnings in src/runtime/ are gone, thanks to
  more patches from Martin Atzmueller.
* Martin Atzmueller pointed out that bug 37 was fixed by his patches
  some time ago.

changes in sbcl-0.6.9 relative to sbcl-0.6.8:

* DESCRIBE now works on CONDITION objects.
* The debugger now handles errors which arise when trying to print
  *DEBUG-CONDITION*, so that it's less likely to fall into infinite
  regress.
* The build system now uses an additional file, customize-target-features.lisp,
  to allow local modifications to the target *FEATURES* list. (The point of
  this is that now I can set up a custom configuration, e.g. with :SB-SHOW
  debugging features enabled, without having to worry about propagating it
  into everyone's system when I do a "cvs update".) When no
  customize-target-features.lisp file exists, the target *FEATURES* list
  should be constructed the same way as before.
* fixed bugs in DEFCONSTANT ANSI-compatibility:
  ** DEFCONSTANT now tests reassignments using EQL, not EQUAL, in order to
     warn about behavior which is undefined under the ANSI spec. Note: This
     is specified by ANSI, but it's not very popular with programmers.
     If it causes you problems, take a look at the new SB-INT:DEFCONSTANT-EQX
     macro in the SBCL sources for an example of a workaround which you
     might use to make portable ANSI-standard code which does what you want.
  ** DEFCONSTANT's implementation is now based on EVAL-WHEN instead of on
     pre-ANSI IR1 translation magic, so it does the ANSI-specified thing
     when it's used as a non-toplevel form. (This is required in order
     to implement the DEFCONSTANT-EQX macro.)
  ** (DEFCONSTANT X 1) (DEFVAR X) (SETF X 2) no longer "works".
  ** Unfortunately, non-toplevel DEFCONSTANT forms can still do some
     funny things, due to bugs in the implementation of EVAL-WHEN
     (bug #IR1-3). This probably won't be fixed until 0.7.x. (Fortunately,
     non-toplevel DEFCONSTANTs are uncommon.)
* The core file version number and fasl file version number have been
  incremented, because the old noncompliant DEFCONSTANT behavior involved
  calling functions which no longer exist, and because I also took the
  opportunity to chop an unsupported slot out of the DEBUG-SOURCE structure.
* fixed bug 1 (error handling before read-eval-print loop starts), and
  redid debugger restarts and related debugger commands somewhat while
  doing so:
  ** The QUIT debugger command is gone, since it did something
     rather different than the SB-EXT:QUIT command, and since it never
     worked properly outside the main toplevel read/eval/print loop.
     Invoking the new TOPLEVEL restart provides the same functionality.
  ** The GO debugger command is also gone, since you can just invoke
     the CONTINUE restart directly instead.
  ** The TOP debugger command is also gone, since it's redundant with the
     FRAME 0 command, and since it interfered with abbreviations for the
     TOPLEVEL restart.
* The system now recovers better from non-PACKAGE values of the *PACKAGE*
  variable.
* The system now understands compound CONS types (e.g. (CONS FIXNUM T))
  as required by ANSI. (thanks to Douglas Crosher's CMU CL patches, with
  some porting work by Martin Atzmueller)
* Martin Atzmueller reviewed the CMU CL mailing lists and came back
  with a boatload of patches which he ported to SBCL. Now that those
  have been applied,
  ** The system tries to make sure that its low-priority messages
     are prefixed by semicolons, to help people who like to use
     syntax highlighting in their ILISP buffer. (This patch
     was originally due to Raymond Toy.)
  ** The system now optimizes INTEGER-LENGTH better, thanks to more
     patches originally written by Raymond Toy.
  ** The compiler understands coercion between single-value and
     multiple-VALUES type expressions better, getting rid of some very
     weird behavior, thanks to patches originally by Robert MacLachlan
     and Douglas Crosher.
  ** The system understands ANSI-style non-KEYWORD &KEY arguments in
     lambda lists, thanks to a patch originally by Pierre Mai.
  ** The system no longer bogusly warns about "abbreviated type
     declarations".
  ** The compiler gets less confused by inlining and RETURN-FROM,
     thanks to some patches originally by Tim Moore.
  ** The system no longer hangs when dumping circular lists to fasl
     files, thanks to a patch originally from Douglas Crosher.
* Martin Atzmueller also fixed ROOM, so that it no longer fails with an
  undefined function error.
* gave up on fixing bug 3 (forbidden-by-ANSI warning for type mismatch
  in structure slot initforms) for now, documented workaround instead:-|
* fixed bug 4 (no WARNING for DECLAIM FTYPE of slot accessor function)
* fixed bug 5: added stubs for various Gray stream functions called
  in the not-a-CL:STREAM case, so that even when Gray streams aren't
  installed, at least appropriate type errors are generated
* fixed bug 8: better reporting of various PROGRAM-ERRORs
* fixed bug 9: IGNORE and IGNORABLE now work reasonably and more
  consistently in DEFMETHOD forms.
* removed bug 21 from BUGS, since Martin Atzmueller points out that
  it doesn't seem to affect SBCL after all
* The C runtime system now builds with better optimization and many
  fewer warnings, thanks to lots of cleanups by Martin Atzmueller.

changes in sbcl-0.6.8 relative to sbcl-0.6.7:

* The system is now under CVS at SourceForge (instead of the
  CVS repository on my home machine).
* The new signal handling code has been tweaked to treat register
  contents as (UNSIGNED-BYTE 32), as the old CMU CL code did,
  instead of (SIGNED-BYTE 32), as the C header files have it. (Code
  downstream, e.g. in debug-int.lisp, has implicit dependencies
  on the unsignedness of integer representation of machine words,
  and that caused the system to bomb out with infinite regress
  when trying to recover from type errors involving signed values,
  e.g. (BUTLAST '(1 2 3) -1).)
* (BUTLAST NIL) and (NBUTLAST NIL) now return NIL as they should.
  (This was one of the bugs Peter Van Eynde reported back in July.)
* The system now uses code inspired by Colin Walters' O(N)
  implementation of MAP (from the cmucl-imp@cons.org mailing
  list, 2 September 2000) when it can't use a DEFTRANSFORM to
  inline the MAP operation, and there is more than one
  sequence argument to the MAP call (so that it can't just
  do ETYPECASE once and for all based on the type of the
  single sequence argument). (The old non-inline implementation
  of the general M-argument sequence-of-length-N case required
  O(M*N*N) time when any of the sequence arguments were LISTs.)
* The QUIT :UNIX-CODE keyword argument has been renamed to
  QUIT :UNIX-STATUS. (The old name still works, but is deprecated.)
* Raymond Wiker's patches to port RUN-PROGRAM from CMU CL to SBCL
  have been added.
* Raymond Wiker's patches to port dynamic loading from Linux to
  FreeBSD have been added.
* The BUGS file is now more nearly up to date, thanks in large part
  to Martin Atzmueller's review of it.
* The debugger now flushes standard output streams before it begins
  its output ("debugger invoked" and so forth).
* The core version number and fasl file version number have both
  been incremented, because of incompatible changes in the layout
  of static symbols.
* FINISH-OUTPUT is now called more consistently on QUIT. (It
  used to not be called for a saved Lisp image.)
* Martin Atzmueller's version of a patch to fix a compiler crash,
  as posted on sbcl-devel 13 September 2000, has been installed.
* Instead of installing Martin Atzmueller's patch for the
  compiler transform for SUBSEQ, I deleted the compiler transform,
  and transforms for some similar consing operations.
* A bug in signal handling which kept TRACE from working on OpenBSD
  has been fixed.
* added enough DEFTRANSFORMs to allow (SXHASH 'FOO) to be optimized
  away by constant folding
* The system now defines its address space constants in one place
  (in the Lisp sources), and propagates them automatically elsewhere
  (through GENESIS and the sbcl.h file). Therefore, patching the
  address map is less unnecessarily tedious and error-prone. The
  Lisp names of address space constants have also been systematized.
* CVS tags like dollar-Header-dollar have been removed from
  the sources, because they have never saved me trouble and
  they've been source of trouble working with patches and other
  diff-related operations.
* fixed the PROG1-vs.-PROGN bug in HANDLER-BIND (reported by
  ole.rohne@cern.ch on cmucl-help@cons.org 2000-10-25)

changes in sbcl-0.6.7 relative to sbcl-0.6.6:

* The system has been ported to OpenBSD.
* The system now compiles with a simple "sh make.sh" on the systems
  that it's supported on. I.e., now you no longer need to tweak
  text in the target-features.lisp-expr and symlinks in src/runtime/
  by hand, the make.sh takes care of it for you.
* The system is no longer so grossly inefficient when compiling code
  involving vectors implemented as general (not simple) vectors (VECTOR T),
  so code which dares to use VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND and FILL-POINTER, or
  which dares to use the various sequence functions on non-simple
  vectors, takes less of a performance hit.
  * There is now a primitive type predicate VECTOR-T-P
    to test for the (VECTOR T) type, so that e.g.
	(DEFUN FOO (V) (DECLARE (TYPE (VECTOR T) V)) (AREF V 3))
    can now be compiled with some semblance of efficiency. (The old code
    turned the type declaration into a full call to %TYPEP at runtime!)
  * AREF on (VECTOR T) is still not fast, since it's still compiled
    as a full call to SB-KERNEL:DATA-VECTOR-REF, but at least the
    ETYPECASE used in DATA-VECTOR-REF is now compiled reasonably
    efficiently. (The old version made full calls to SUBTYPEP at runtime!)
  * (MAKE-ARRAY 12 :FILL-POINTER T) is now executed less inefficiently,
    without making full calls to SUBTYPEP at runtime.
  (Some analogous efficiency issues for non-simple vectors specialized to
  element types other than T, or for non-simple multidimensional arrays,
  have not been addressed. They could almost certainly be handled the
  same way if anyone is motivated to do so.)
* The changes in array handling break binary compatibility, so
  *BACKEND-FASL-FILE-VERSION* has been bumped to 4.
* (TYPEP (MAKE-ARRAY 12 :FILL-POINTER 4) 'VECTOR) now returns (VALUES T)
  instead of (VALUES T T).
* By following the instructions that Dan Barlow posted to sbcl-devel
  on 2 July 2000, I was able to enable primitive dynamic object
  file loading code for Linux. The full-blown CMU CL LOAD-FOREIGN
  functionality is not implemented (since it calls ld to resolve
  library references automatically, requiring RUN-PROGRAM for its
  implementation), but a simpler SB-EXT:LOAD-1-FOREIGN (which doesn't
  try to resolve library references) is now supported.
* The system now flushes the standard output streams when it terminates,
  unless QUIT is used with the RECKLESSLY-P option set. It also flushes
  them at several other probably-convenient times, e.g. in each pass of
  the toplevel read-eval-print loop, and after evaluating a form given
  as an "--eval" command-line option. (These changes were motivated by a
  discussion of stream flushing issues on cmucl-imp in August 2000.)
* The source transform for TYPEP of array types no longer assumes
  that an array whose element type is a not-yet-defined type
  is implemented as an array of T, but instead punts, so that the
  type will be interpreted at runtime.
* There is now some support for cross-compiling in make.sh: each of
  the phases of make.sh has its own script. (This should be transparent
  to people doing ordinary, non-cross-compile builds.)
* Since my laptop doesn't have hundreds of megabytes of memory like
  my desktop machine, I became more motivated to do some items on
  my to-do list in order to reduce the size of the system a little:
  ** Arrange for various needed-only-at-cold-init things to be
     uninterned after cold init. To support this, those things have
     been renamed from FOO and *FOO* to !FOO and *!FOO* (i.e., all
     symbols with such names are now uninterned after cold init).
  ** Bind SB!C::*TOP-LEVEL-LAMBDA-MAX* to a nonzero value when building
     fasl files for cold load.
  ** Remove the old compiler structure pooling code (which used to
     be conditional on the target feature :SB-ALLOC) completely.
  ** Redo the representation of some data in cold init to be more compact.
  (I also looked into supporting byte compiled code at bootstrap time,
  which would probably reduce the size of the system a lot, but that
  looked too complicated, so I punted for now.)
* The maximum signal nesting depth in the src/runtime/ support code has
  been reduced from 4096 to 256. (I don't know any reason for the very
  large old value. If the new smaller value turns out to break something,
  I'll probably just bump it back up.)
* PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK is now pickier about the types of its arguments,
  as per ANSI.
* Many, many bugs reported by Peter Van Eynde have been added to
  the BUGS list; some have even been fixed.
* While enabling dynamic object file loading, I tried to make the
  code easier to understand, renaming various functions and variables
  with less ambiguous names, and changing some function calling
  conventions to be Lispier (e.g. returning NIL instead of 0 for failure).
* While trying to figure out how to do the OpenBSD port, I tried to
  clean up some of the code in src/runtime/. In particular, I dropped
  support for non-POSIX signal handling, added various comments,
  tweaked the code to reduce the number of compilation warnings, and
  renamed some files to increase consistency.
* To support the new automatic configuration functionality in make.sh,
  the source file target-features.lisp-expr has been replaced with the
  source file base-target-features.lisp-expr and the machine-generated
  file local-target-features.lisp-expr.
* fixed a stupid quoting error in make.sh so that using CMU CL
  "lisp -batch" as cross-compilation host works again

changes in sbcl-0.6.6 relative to sbcl-0.6.5:

* DESCRIBE no longer tries to call itself recursively to describe
  bound/fbound values, so that it no longer fails on symbols which are
  bound to themselves (like keywords, T, and NIL).
* DESCRIBE now works on generic functions.
* The printer now prints less-screwed-up representations of closures
  (not naively trying to bogusly use the %FUNCTION-NAME accessor on them).
* A private symbol is used instead of the :EMPTY keyword previously
  used to mark empty slots in hash tables. Thus
	(DEFVAR *HT* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE))
	(SETF (GETHASH :EMPTY *HT*) :EMPTY)
	(MAPHASH (LAMBDA (K V) (FORMAT T "~&~S ~S~%" K V)))
  now does what ANSI says that it should. (You can still get
  similar noncompliant behavior if bang on the hash table
  implementation with all the symbols you get back from
  DO-ALL-SYMBOLS, but at least that's a little harder to do.)
  This breaks binary compatibility, since tests for equality to
  :EMPTY are wired into things like the macroexpansion of
  WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR in FASL files produced by earlier
  implementations.
* There's now a minimal placeholder implementation for CL:STEP,
  as required by ANSI.
* An obscure bug in the interaction of the normal compiler, the byte
  compiler, inlining, and structure predicates has been patched
  by setting the flags for the DEFTRANSFORM of %INSTANCE-TYPEP as
  :WHEN :BOTH (as per Raymond Toy's suggestion on the cmucl-imp@cons.org
  mailing list).
* Missing ordinary arguments in a macro call are now detected even
  when the macro lambda list contains &KEY or &REST.
* The debugger no longer complains about encountering the top of the
  stack when you type "FRAME 0" to explicitly instruct it to go to
  the top of the stack. And it now prints the frame you request even
  if it's the current frame (instead of saying "You are here.").
* As specified by ANSI, the system now always prints keywords
  as #\: followed by SYMBOL-NAME, even when *PACKAGE* is the
  KEYWORD package.
* The default initial SIZE of HASH-TABLEs is now smaller.
* Type information from CLOS class dispatch is now propagated
  into DEFMETHOD bodies, so that e.g.
	(DEFMETHOD FOO ((X SINGLE-FLOAT))
	  (+ X 123.0))
  is now basically equivalent to
	(DEFMETHOD FOO ((X SINGLE-FLOAT))
	  (DECLARE (TYPE SINGLE-FLOAT X))
	  (+ X 123.0))
  and the compiler can compile (+ X 123.0) as a SINGLE-FLOAT-only
  operation, without having to do run-time type dispatch.
* The macroexpansion of DEFMETHOD has been tweaked so that it has
  reasonable behavior when arguments are declared IGNORE or IGNORABLE.
* Since I don't seem to be making big file reorganizations very often
  any more (and since my archive of sbcl-x.y.zv.tar.bz2 snapshots
  is overflowing my ability to conveniently back them up), I've finally
  checked the system into CVS. (The CVS repository is on my home system,
  not at SourceForge -- putting it on SourceForge might come later.)
* SB-EXT:*GC-NOTIFY-STREAM* has been added, to control where the
  high-level GC-NOTIFY-FOO functions send their output. (There's
  still very little control of where low-level verbose GC functions
  send their output.) The SB-EXT:*GC-VERBOSE* variable now controls
  less than it used to -- the GC-NOTIFY-FOO functions are now under
  the control of *GC-NOTIFY-STREAM*, not *GC-VERBOSE*.
* The system now stores the version string (LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION)
  in only one place in the source code, and propagates it automatically
  everywhere that it's needed. Thus e.g. when I bump the version from
  0.6.6 to 0.6.7, I'll only need to modify the sources in one place.
* The C source files now include boilerplate legalese and documentation
  at the head of each file (just as the Lisp source files already did).
* At Dan Barlow's suggestion, the hyperlink from the SBCL website
  to his page will be replaced with a link to his new CLiki service.

changes in sbcl-0.6.5 relative to sbcl-0.6.4:

* Raymond Wiker's patches to port the system to FreeBSD have been merged.
* The build process now looks for GNU make under the default name "gmake",
  instead of "make" as it used to. If GNU make is not available as "gmake"
  on your system, you can change this default behavior by setting the
  GNUMAKE environment variable.
* Replace #+SB-DOC with #!+SB-DOC in seq.lisp so that the system
  can build without error under CMU CL.

changes in sbcl-0.6.4 relative to sbcl-0.6.3:

* There is now a partial SBCL user manual (with some new text and some
  text cribbed from the CMU CL manual).
* The beginnings of a profiler have been added (starting with the
  CMU CL profiler and simplifying and cleaning up). Eventually the
  main interface should be through the TRACE macro, but for now,
  it's still accessed through vaguely CMU-CL-style functions and macros
  exported from the package SB-PROFILE.
* Some problems left over from porting CMU CL to the new
  cross-compilation bootstrap process have been cleaned up:
  ** DISASSEMBLE now works. (There was a problem in using DEFMACRO
     instead of SB!XC:DEFMACRO, compounded by an oversight on my
     part when getting rid of the compiler *BACKEND* stuff.)
  ** The value of *NULL-TYPE* was screwed up, because it was
     being initialized before the type system knew the final
     definition of the 'NULL type. This screwed up several key
     optimizations in the compiler, causing inefficiency in all sorts
     of places. (I found it because I wanted to understand why
     GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME was consing.)
* fixed a bug in DEFGENERIC which was causing it to overwrite preexisting
  PROCLAIM FTYPE information. Unfortunately this broke binary
  compatibility again, since now the forms output by DEFGENERIC
  to refer to functions which didn't exist in 0.6.3.
* added declarations so that SB-PCL::USE-CACHING-DFUN-P
  can use the new (as of 0.6.3) transform for SOME into MAP into
  inline code
* changed (MOD 1000000) type declarations for Linux timeval.tv_usec slot
  values to (INTEGER 0 1000000), so that the time code will no longer
  occasionally get blown up by Linux returning 1000000 microseconds
* PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT has been tweaked to make the spacing of
  its output conform to the ANSI spec. (Alas, this makes its output
  uglier in the :TYPE T :IDENTITY NIL case, but them's the breaks.)
* A full call to MAP NIL with a single sequence argument no longer conses.
* fixes to problems pointed out by Martin Atzmueller:
  * The manual page no longer talks about multiprocessing as though
    it were currently supported.
  * The ILISP support patches have been removed from the distribution,
    because as of version 5.10.1, ILISP now supports SBCL without us
    having to maintain patches.
* added a modified version of Raymond Toy's recent CMU CL patch for
  EQUALP comparison of HASH-TABLE

changes in sbcl-0.6.3 relative to sbcl-0.6.2:

* The system still can't cross-compile itself with
  *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED* (and all the consistency checks that
  entails), but at least it can compile more of itself that way
  than it used to be able to, and various buglets which were uncovered
  by trying to cross-compile itself that way have now been fixed.
* This release breaks binary compatibility again. This time
  at least I've incremented the FASL file format version to 2, so that the
  problem can be detected reliably instead of just causing weird errors.
* various new style warnings:
  ** using DEFUN, DEFMETHOD, or DEFGENERIC to overwrite an old definition
  ** using the deprecated EVAL/LOAD/COMPILE situation names in EVAL-WHEN
  ** using the lexical binding of a variable named in the *FOO* style
* DESCRIBE has been substantially rewritten. It now calls DESCRIBE-OBJECT
  as specified by ANSI.
* *RANDOM-STATE* is no longer automatically initialized from
  (GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME), but instead from a constant seed. Thus, the
  default behavior of the system is to repeat its behavior every time
  it's run. If you'd like to change this behavior, you can always
  explicitly set the seed from (GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME); whereas under the
  old convention there was no comparably easy way to get the system to
  repeat its behavior every time it was run.
* Support for the pre-CLTL2 interpretation of FUNCTION declarations as
  FTYPE declarations has been removed, in favor of their ANSI
  interpretation as TYPE FUNCTION declarations. (See p. 228 of CLTL2.)
* The quantifiers SOME, EVERY, NOTANY, and NOTEVERY no longer cons when
  the types of their sequence arguments can be determined at compile time.
  This is done through a new open code expansion for MAP which eliminates
  consing for (MAP NIL ..), and reduces consing otherwise, when sequence
  argument types can be determined at compile time.
* The optimizer now transforms COERCE into an identity operation when it
  can prove that the coerced object is already of the correct type. (This
  can be a win for machine generated code, including the output of other
  optimization transforms, such as the MAP transform above.)
* Credit information has been moved from source file headers into CREDITS.
* Source file headers have been made more standard.
* The CASE macro now compiles without complaining even when it has
  no clauses.

changes in sbcl-0.6.2 relative to sbcl-0.6.1:

* (Note that the way that the PCL macroexpansions were rewritten
  to accommodate the change in DEFGENERIC below breaks binary
  compatibility. That is, fasl files compiled under sbcl-0.6.1 may
  not run under sbcl-0.6.2. Once we get out of alpha releases,
  i.e. hit release 1.0.0, we'll probably try to maintain binary
  compatibility between maintenance releases, e.g. between sbcl-1.4.3
  and sbcl-1.4.4. Until then, however, it might be fairly common
  for maintenance releases to break binary compatibility.)
* A bug in the calculation of WARNINGS-P and FAILURE-P in COMPILE-FILE
  has been fixed.
* The reporting of unhandled signals has been changed to print some
  explanatory text as well as the report form. (Previously only
  the report form was printed.)
* The macroexpansion for DEFGENERIC now DECLAIMs the function that
  it defines, so that the compiler no longer issues undefined function
  warnings for compiled-but-not-yet-loaded generic functions.
* The CLTL-style "LISP" and "USER" nicknames for the "COMMON-LISP"
  and "COMMON-LISP-USER" packages have been removed. Now only the "CL"
  and "CL-USER" standard nicknames from the "11.1.2 Standardized Packages"
  section of the ANSI spec are supported.
* The "" nickname for the "KEYWORD" package has been removed.
  The reader still handles symbol tokens which begin with a package marker
  as keywords, but it doesn't expose its mechanism for doing so in the
  (PACKAGE-NICKNAMES (FIND-PACKAGE "KEYWORD")) list.
* The system now issues STYLE-WARNINGs for contradictory TYPE
  proclamations. (Warnings for contradictory FTYPE proclamations would
  be nice too, but those can't be done usefully unless the type system
  is made smarter about FUNCTION types.)
* The names of source files "*host-*.lisp" and "*target-*.lisp" have been
  systematized, so that "*target-*.lisp is supposed to exist only on the
  target and imply that there's a related file which exists on the
  host, and *host-*.lisp is supposed to exist only on the host and imply
  that there's a related file which exists on the target. This involves a
  lot of renaming. Hopefully the acute confusion caused by the renaming
  will be justified by the reduction in chronic confusion..

  ** host-defstruct.lisp  -> defstruct.lisp
  ** late-target-type.lisp -> deftypes-for-target.lisp
  Furthermore, several other previously target-only files foo.lisp (e.g.
  hash-table.lisp and random.lisp) have been split into a target-and-host
  foo.lisp file and a target-only target-foo.lisp file, with their key type
  definitions in the target-and-host part, so that the cross-compiler will
  know more about target types.
* DEFSTRUCT BACKEND, and the BACKEND-valued *BACKEND* variable, have
  gone away. In their place are various *BACKEND-FOO* variables
  corresponding to the slots of the old structure.
* A bug which caused the SB-COLD bootstrap-time package to be propagated
  into the target SBCL has been fixed.
* The chill.lisp system for loading cold code into a running SBCL
  now works better.
* Support for the CMU CL "scavenger hook" extension has been removed.
  (It was undocumented and unused in the CMU CL sources that SBCL was
  derived from, and stale in sbcl-0.6.1.)
* Various errors in the cross-compiler type system were detected
  by running the cross-compiler with *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED*
  (enabling various consistency checks). Many of them were fixed,
  but some hard problems remain, so the compiler is back to
  running without *TYPE-SYSTEM-INITIALIZED* for now.
* As part of the cross-compiler type system cleanup, I implemented
  DEF!TYPE and got rid of early-ugly-duplicates.lisp.
* I have started adding UNCROSS calls throughout the type system
  and the INFO database. (Thus perhaps eventually the blanket UNCROSS
  on cross-compiler input files will be able to go away, and various
  kludges with it).
* CONSTANTP now returns true for quoted forms (as explicitly required
  by the ANSI spec).

changes in sbcl-0.6.1 relative to sbcl-0.6.0:

* changed build optimization from (SAFETY 1) to (SAFETY 3) as a short-term
  fix for various type-unsafety bugs, e.g. failures with (LENGTH 123) and
  (MAKE-LIST -1). In the longer term, it ought to become true
  that declarations are assertions even at SAFETY 1. For now, it's not
  quite true even at SAFETY 3, but it's at least more nearly true..
  (Note that this change seems to increases the size of the system by
  O(5%) and to decrease the speed of the compiler by 20% or more.)
* changed ALIEN printing to be much more abbreviated, as a short-term fix
  for the problem of printing dozens of lines of distracting information
  about low-level system machinery as part of the top stack frame
  on entry to the debugger when an undefined function was called.
* tweaked the debugger's use of WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX so that *PACKAGE*
  is not reset to COMMON-LISP-USER.
* Compilation of stuff related to dyncount.lisp has been made conditional
  on the :SB-DYNCOUNT target feature, so that the ordinary core system is
  smaller. The various dyncount-related symbols have been moved into
  a new "SB-DYNCOUNT" package.
* tty-inspect.lisp has been renamed to inspect.lisp.
* unix-glibc2.lisp has been renamed to unix.lisp, and the :GLIBC2
  feature has gone away. (When we eventually port to other flavors of
  libc and/or Unix, we'll try to make the differences between flavors
  invisible at the user level.)
* Various other *FEATURES* tags, and/or their associated conditionals,
  have been removed if obsolescent, or given better documentation, or
  sometimes given more-mnemonic names.

changes in sbcl-0.6.0 relative to sbcl-0.5.0:

* tidied up "make.sh" script
* tidied up system directory structure
* better "clean.sh" behavior
* added doc/FOR-CMUCL-DEVELOPERS
* many many small tweaks to output format, e.g. removing possibly-confusing
  trailing #\. character in DESCRIBE-INSTANCE
* (EQUALP #\A 'A) no longer signals an error.
* new hashing code, including EQUALP hashing
* tidied up Lisp initialization and toplevel
* initialization files (e.g. /etc/sbclrc and $HOME/.sbclrc)
* command line argument processing
* added POSIX-GETENV function to deal with Unix-ish environment variables
* more-Unixy handling of *STANDARD-INPUT* and other Lisp streams, e.g.
  terminating SBCL on EOF
* non-verbose GC by default
* There is no more "sbcl" shell script; the sbcl file is now the C
  runtime executable (just like CMU CL).
* removed some unused fops, e.g. FOP-UNIFORM-VECTOR, FOP-CHARACTER, and
  FOP-POP-FOR-EFFECT
* tweaked debug-info.lisp and debug-int.lisp to make the debugger store
  symbol and package information as Lisp native symbol and package objects
  instead of strings naming symbols and strings naming packages. This way,
  whenever packages are renamed (as in warm init), debug information is
  transformed along with everything else.
* tweaked the optimization policy declarations which control the building
  of SBCL itself. Now, among other things, the system no longer saves
  source location debugging information. (This helps two problems at once
  by reducing SBCL size and by keeping SBCL from trying to look for its
  sources -- which may not exist -- when reporting errors.)
* added src/cold/chill.lisp, to let SBCL read its own cold sources for
  debugging and testing purposes
* cleaned up printing, making the printer call PRINT-OBJECT for
  instances, and using PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT for most PRINT-OBJECT
  methods, giving nearly-ANSI behavior
* converted almost all special variables to use *FOO* naming convention
* deleted PARSE-TIME functionality, since it can be done portably
* moved some files out of cold init into warm init
* deleted DEFUN UNDEFINED-VALUE, replaced (UNDEFINED-VALUE) forms
  with (VALUES) forms
* regularized formatting of source files
* added an install.sh script
* fixed ridiculous memory usage of cross-compiler by making
  compiler/alloc.lisp not try to do pooling unless it can hook
  itself into the GC of the cross-compilation host. Now the system
  builds nicely on my old laptop.
* added :SB-ALLOC in target-features.lisp-expr
* deleted mention of :ANSI-DOC from target-features.lisp-expr (since it
  was not implemented)
* re-did condition handling and note reporting in the compiler. Notes
  are no longer handled by signalling conditions. Style warnings
  and warnings are handled more correctly and reported in such a way
  that it's easy to find one or the other in your output (so that you
  can e.g. figure out which of many problems caused COMPILE-FILE to
  return FAILURE-P).
* changed the severity of several compiler warnings from full WARNING
  to STYLE-WARNING in order to conform with the ANSI spec; also changed
  compiler note reporting so that it doesn't use the condition system
  at all (and hence affects neither FAILURE-P nor WARNINGS-P in the
  COMPILE-FILE command)
* made PROCLAIM and DECLAIM conform to ANSI. PROCLAIM is now an ordinary
  function. As a consequence, START-BLOCK and END-BLOCK declarations are
  no longer supported, since their implementation was deeply intertwingled
  with the magical, non-ANSI treatment that PROCLAIM received in CMU CL.
* removed bogus "support" for compiler macros named (SETF FOO), and
  removed the compiler macro for SETF INFO (but only after making a fool
  of myself on the cmucl-imp mailing list by posting a bogus patch for
  DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO..)
* Compiled files containing forms which have side effects on the Lisp
  reader (such as DEFPACKAGE forms) are now handled more correctly.
  (Compiler queuing of top level lambdas has been suppressed by setting
  *TOP-LEVEL-LAMBDA-MAX* to 0. )
* deleted various currently-unused source files, e.g. gengc.lisp. They
  may be added back at some point e.g. when porting to other architectures,
  but until they are it's distracting to distribute them and to try to
  maintain them.
* deleted "UNCROSS couldn't recurse through.." style warnings, since
  there were so many of them they're just distractions, and UNCROSS is
  known to be able to handle the current sources
* moved PROFILE functionality into TRACE, so that it will be clear
  how the wrapping and unwrapping of functions when you profile them
  interacts with the wrapping and unwrapping of functions when you
  trace them. (Actually, the functionality isn't there yet, but at least
  the interface specification is there. Hopefully, the functionality will
  arrive with some future maintenance release.)
* removed host-oops.lisp
* changed signature of QUIT function to allow UNIX-CODE argument
* fixed READ-SEQUENCE bug
* tweaked verbose GC output so that it looks more like the progress
  output that ANSI specifies for functions like LOAD
* set up the system on sourceforge.com, with home pages, mailing lists, etc.
* added <http://sbcl.sourceforge.com> to the banner information printed by
  the sbcl executable
