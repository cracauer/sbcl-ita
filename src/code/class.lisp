;;;; built-in classes

;;; The BUILT-IN-CLASSES list is a data structure which configures the
;;; creation of all the built-in classes. It contains all the info
;;; that we need to maintain the mapping between classes, compile-time
;;; types and run-time type codes. These options are defined:
;;;
;;; :TRANSLATION (default none)
;;;     When this class is "parsed" as a type specifier, it is
;;;     translated into the specified internal type representation,
;;;     rather than being left as a class. This is used for types
;;;     which we want to canonicalize to some other kind of type
;;;     object because in general we want to be able to include more
;;;     information than just the class (e.g. for numeric types.)
;;;
;;; :STATE (default :SEALED)
;;;     The value of CLASS-STATE which we want on completion,
;;;     indicating whether subclasses can be created at run-time.
;;;
;;; :HIERARCHICAL-P (default T unless any of the inherits are non-hierarchical)
;;;     True if we can assign this class a unique inheritance depth.
;;;
;;; :CODES (default none)
;;;     Run-time type codes which should be translated back to this
;;;     class by CLASS-OF. Unspecified for abstract classes.
;;;
;;; :INHERITS (default this class and T)
;;;     The class-precedence list for this class, with this class and
;;;     T implicit.
;;;
;;; :DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES (default to head of CPL)
;;;     List of the direct superclasses of this class.
;;;
;;; NB: not to be confused with SB-PCL::*BUILT-IN-CLASSES*
