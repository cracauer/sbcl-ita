;;;; representations of types

;;; A HAIRY-TYPE represents anything too weird to be described
;;; reasonably or to be useful, such as NOT, SATISFIES, unknown types,
;;; and unreasonably complicated types involving AND. We just remember
;;; the original type spec.
;;; A possible improvement would be for HAIRY-TYPE to have a subtype
;;; named SATISFIES-TYPE for the hairy types which are specifically
;;; of the form (SATISFIES pred) so that we don't have to examine
;;; the sexpr repeatedly to decide whether it takes that form.
;;; And as a further improvement, we might want a table that maps
;;; predicates to their exactly recognized type when possible.
;;; We have such a table in fact - *BACKEND-PREDICATE-TYPES*
;;; as a starting point. But something like PLUSP isn't in there.
;;; On the other hand, either of these points may not be sources of
;;; inefficiency, and the latter if implemented might have undesirable
;;; user-visible ramifications, though it seems unlikely.
