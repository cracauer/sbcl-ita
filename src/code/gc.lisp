;;;; SUB-GC

;;; SUB-GC does a garbage collection.  This is called from three places:
;;; (1) The C runtime will call here when it detects that we've consed
;;;     enough to exceed the gc trigger threshold.  This is done in
;;;     alloc() for gencgc or interrupt_maybe_gc() for cheneygc
;;; (2) The user may request a collection using GC, below
;;; (3) At the end of a WITHOUT-GCING section, we are called if
;;;     *NEED-TO-COLLECT-GARBAGE* is true
;;;
;;; This is different from the behaviour in 0.7 and earlier: it no
;;; longer decides whether to GC based on thresholds.  If you call
;;; SUB-GC you will definitely get a GC either now or when the
;;; WITHOUT-GCING is over

;;; For GENCGC all generations < GEN will be GC'ed.
