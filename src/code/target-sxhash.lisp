;;; the depthoid explored when calculating hash values

;;; "Depthoid" here is a sort of mixture of what Common Lisp ordinarily calls
;;; depth and what Common Lisp ordinarily calls length; it's incremented either
;;; when we descend into a compound object or when we step through elements of
;;; a compound object.

;;;; mixing hash values

;;; a function for mixing hash values
;;;
;;; desiderata:
;;;   * Non-commutativity keeps us from hashing e.g. #(1 5) to the
;;;     same value as #(5 1), and ending up in real trouble in some
;;;     special cases like bit vectors the way that CMUCL 18b SXHASH
;;;     does. (Under CMUCL 18b, SXHASH of any bit vector is 1..)
;;;   * We'd like to scatter our hash values over the entire possible range
;;;     of values instead of hashing small or common key values (like
;;;     2 and NIL and #\a) to small FIXNUMs the way that the CMUCL 18b
;;;     SXHASH function does, again helping to avoid pathologies like
;;;     hashing all bit vectors to 1.
;;;   * We'd like this to be simple and fast, too.

  ;;     the multiplication in the calculation of XY, and shifted
  ;;     right by up to 5 places by the ASH).
  ;;   * The #'+ and #'LOGXOR operations don't commute with each other,
  ;;     so different bit patterns are mixed together as they shift
  ;;     past each other.
  ;;   * The arbitrary constant XOR used in the LOGXOR expression is
