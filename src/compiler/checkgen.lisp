;;; Loop over all blocks in COMPONENT that have TYPE-CHECK set,
;;; looking for CASTs with TYPE-CHECK T. We do two mostly unrelated
;;; things: detect compile-time type errors and determine if and how
;;; to do run-time type checks.
;;;
;;; If there is a compile-time type error, then we mark the CAST and
;;; emit a warning if appropriate. This part loops over all the uses
;;; of the continuation, since after we convert the check, the
;;; :DELETED kind will inhibit warnings about the types of other uses.
;;;
;;; If the cast is too complex to be checked by the back end, or is
;;; better checked with explicit code, then convert to an explicit
;;; test. Assertions that can checked by the back end are passed
;;; through. Assertions that can't be tested are flamed about and
;;; marked as not needing to be checked.
;;;
;;; If we determine that a type check won't be done, then we set
;;; TYPE-CHECK to :NO-CHECK. In the non-hairy cases, this is just to
;;; prevent us from wasting time coming to the same conclusion again
;;; on a later iteration. In the hairy case, we must indicate to LTN
;;; that it must choose a safe implementation, since IR2 conversion
;;; will choke on the check.
;;;
;;; The generation of the type checks is delayed until all the type
;;; check decisions have been made because the generation of the type
;;; checks creates new nodes whose derived types aren't always updated
;;; which may lead to inappropriate template choices due to the
;;; modification of argument types.
