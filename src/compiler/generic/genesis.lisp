;;;; "cold" core image builder: This is how we create a target Lisp
;;;; system from scratch, by converting from fasl files to an image
;;;; file in the cross-compilation host, without the help of the
;;;; target Lisp system.
;;;;
;;;; As explained by Rob MacLachlan on the CMU CL mailing list Wed, 06
;;;; Jan 1999 11:05:02 -0500, this cold load generator more or less
;;;; fakes up static function linking. I.e. it makes sure that all the
;;;; DEFUN-defined functions in the fasl files it reads are bound to the
;;;; corresponding symbols before execution starts. It doesn't do
;;;; anything to initialize variable values; instead it just arranges
;;;; for !COLD-INIT to be called at cold load time. !COLD-INIT is
;;;; responsible for explicitly initializing anything which has to be
;;;; initialized early before it transfers control to the ordinary
;;;; top level forms.
;;;;
;;;; (In CMU CL, and in SBCL as of 0.6.9 anyway, functions not defined
;;;; by DEFUN aren't set up specially by GENESIS.)

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; This software is derived from the CMU CL system, which was
;;;; written at Carnegie Mellon University and released into the
;;;; public domain. The software is in the public domain and is

  ;; Everything between this preserved-for-posterity comment down to
  ;; the assignment of *CURRENT-CATCH-BLOCK* could be entirely deleted,
  ;; including the list of *C-CALLABLE-STATIC-SYMBOLS* itself,
  ;; if it is GC-safe for the C runtime to have its own implementation
  ;; of the INFO-VECTOR-FDEFN function in a multi-threaded build.
  ;;
  ;;   "I think the point of setting these functions into SYMBOL-VALUEs
  ;;    here, instead of using SYMBOL-FUNCTION, is that in CMU CL
  ;;    SYMBOL-FUNCTION reduces to FDEFINITION, which is a pretty
  ;;    hairy operation (involving globaldb.lisp etc.) which we don't
  ;;    want to invoke early in cold init. -- WHN 2001-12-05"
  ;;
  ;; So... that's no longer true. We _do_ associate symbol -> fdefn in genesis.
  ;; Additionally, the INFO-VECTOR-FDEFN function is extremely simple and could
  ;; easily be implemented in C. However, info-vectors are inevitably
  ;; reallocated when new info is attached to a symbol, so the vectors can't be
  ;; in static space; they'd gradually become permanent garbage if they did.
  ;; That's the real reason for preserving the approach of storing an #<fdefn>
  ;; in a symbol's value cell - that location is static, the symbol-info is not.

  ;; FIXME: So OK, that's a reasonable reason to do something weird like
  ;; this, but this is still a weird thing to do, and we should change
  ;; the names to highlight that something weird is going on. Perhaps
  ;; *MAYBE-GC-FUN*, *INTERNAL-ERROR-FUN*, *HANDLE-BREAKPOINT-FUN*,
  ;; and *HANDLE-FUN-END-BREAKPOINT-FUN*...
