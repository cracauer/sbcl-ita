;;;; source-hacking defining forms

;;; Parse a DEFMACRO-style lambda-list, setting things up so that a
;;; compiler error happens if the syntax is invalid.
;;;
;;; Define a function that converts a special form or other magical
;;; thing into IR1. LAMBDA-LIST is a defmacro style lambda
;;; list. START-VAR, NEXT-VAR and RESULT-VAR are bound to the start and
;;; result continuations for the resulting IR1. KIND is the function
;;; kind to associate with NAME.
;;; FIXME - Translators which accept implicit PROGNs fail on improper
;;; input, e.g. (LAMBDA (X) (CATCH X (BAZ) . 3))
;;; This is because &REST is defined to allow a dotted tail in macros,
;;; and we have no implementation-specific workaround to disallow it.

;;; (This is similar to DEF-IR1-TRANSLATOR, except that we pass if the
;;; syntax is invalid.)
;;;
;;; Define a macro-like source-to-source transformation for the
;;; function NAME. A source transform may "pass" by returning a
;;; non-nil second value. If the transform passes, then the form is
;;; converted as a normal function call. If the supplied arguments are
;;; not compatible with the specified LAMBDA-LIST, then the transform
;;; automatically passes.
;;;
;;; Source transforms may only be defined for functions. Source
;;; transformation is not attempted if the function is declared
;;; NOTINLINE. Source transforms should not examine their arguments.
;;; A macro lambda list which destructures more than one level would
;;; be legal but suspicious, as inner list parsing "examines" arguments.
;;; If it matters how the function is used, then DEFTRANSFORM should
;;; be used to define an IR1 transformation.
;;;
;;; If the desirability of the transformation depends on the current
;;; OPTIMIZE parameters, then the POLICY macro should be used to
;;; determine when to pass.
;;;
;;; Note that while a compiler-macro must deal with being invoked when its
;;; whole form matches (FUNCALL <f> ...) so that it must skip over <f> to find
;;; the arguments, a source-transform need not worry about that situation.
;;; Any FUNCALL which is eligible for a source-transform calls the expander
;;; with the form's head replaced by a compiler representation of the function.
;;; Internalizing the name avoids semantic problems resulting from syntactic
;;; substitution. One problem would be that a source-transform can exist for
;;; a function named (SETF X), but ((SETF X) arg ...) would be bad syntax.
;;; Even if we decided that it is ok within the compiler - just not in code
;;; given to the compiler - the problem remains that changing (FUNCALL 'F x)
;;; to (F x) is wrong when F also names a local functionoid.
;;; Hence, either a #<GLOBAL-VAR> or #<DEFINED-FUN> appears in the form head.

;;;; DEFTRANSFORM

;;; Define an IR1 transformation for NAME. An IR1 transformation
;;; computes a lambda that replaces the function variable reference
;;; for the call. A transform may pass (decide not to transform the
;;; call) by calling the GIVE-UP-IR1-TRANSFORM function. LAMBDA-LIST
;;; both determines how the current call is parsed and specifies the
;;; LAMBDA-LIST for the resulting lambda.
;;;
;;; We parse the call and bind each of the lambda-list variables to
;;; the lvar which represents the value of the argument. When parsing
;;; the call, we ignore the defaults, and always bind the variables
;;; for unsupplied arguments to NIL. If a required argument is
;;; missing, an unknown keyword is supplied, or an argument keyword is
;;; not a constant, then the transform automatically passes. The
;;; DECLARATIONS apply to the bindings made by DEFTRANSFORM at
;;; transformation time, rather than to the variables of the resulting
;;; lambda. Bound-but-not-referenced warnings are suppressed for the
;;; lambda-list variables. The DOC-STRING is used when printing
;;; efficiency notes about the defined transform.
;;;
;;; Normally, the body evaluates to a form which becomes the body of
;;; an automatically constructed lambda. We make LAMBDA-LIST the
;;; lambda-list for the lambda, and automatically insert declarations
;;; of the argument and result types. If the second value of the body
;;; is non-null, then it is a list of declarations which are to be
;;; inserted at the head of the lambda. Automatic lambda generation
;;; may be inhibited by explicitly returning a lambda from the body.
;;;
;;; The ARG-TYPES and RESULT-TYPE are used to create a function type
;;; which the call must satisfy before transformation is attempted.
;;; The function type specifier is constructed by wrapping (FUNCTION
;;; ...) around these values, so the lack of a restriction may be
;;; specified by omitting the argument or supplying *. The argument
;;; syntax specified in the ARG-TYPES need not be the same as that in
;;; the LAMBDA-LIST, but the transform will never happen if the
;;; syntaxes can't be satisfied simultaneously. If there is an
;;; existing transform for the same function that has the same type,
;;; then it is replaced with the new definition.
;;;
;;; These are the legal keyword options:
;;;   :RESULT - A variable which is bound to the result lvar.
;;;   :NODE   - A variable which is bound to the combination node for the call.
;;;   :POLICY - A form which is supplied to the POLICY macro to determine
;;;             whether this transformation is appropriate. If the result
;;;             is false, then the transform automatically gives up.
;;;   :EVAL-NAME
;;;           - The name and argument/result types are actually forms to be
;;;             evaluated. Useful for getting closures that transform similar
;;;             functions.
;;;   :DEFUN-ONLY
;;;           - Don't actually instantiate a transform, instead just DEFUN
;;;             Name with the specified transform definition function. This
;;;             may be later instantiated with %DEFTRANSFORM.
;;;   :IMPORTANT
;;;           - If the transform fails and :IMPORTANT is
;;;               NIL,       then never print an efficiency note.
;;;               :SLIGHTLY, then print a note if SPEED>=INHIBIT-WARNINGS.
;;;               T,         then print a note if SPEED>INHIBIT-WARNINGS.
;;;             :SLIGHTLY is the default.
