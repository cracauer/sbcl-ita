;;;; WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT and WITH-COMPILATION-VALUES

(defmacro sb!xc:with-compilation-unit (options &body body)
  #!+sb-doc
  "Affects compilations that take place within its dynamic extent. It is
intended to be eg. wrapped around the compilation of all files in the same system.

Following options are defined:

  :OVERRIDE Boolean-Form
      One of the effects of this form is to delay undefined warnings until the
      end of the form, instead of giving them at the end of each compilation.
      If OVERRIDE is NIL (the default), then the outermost
      WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form grabs the undefined warnings. Specifying
      OVERRIDE true causes that form to grab any enclosed warnings, even if it
      is enclosed by another WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

  :POLICY Optimize-Declaration-Form
      Provides dynamic scoping for global compiler optimization qualities and
      restrictions, limiting effects of subsequent OPTIMIZE proclamations and
      calls to SB-EXT:RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY to the dynamic scope of BODY.

      If OVERRIDE is false, specified POLICY is merged with current global
      policy. If OVERRIDE is true, current global policy, including any
      restrictions, is discarded in favor of the specified POLICY.

      Supplying POLICY NIL is equivalent to the option not being supplied at
      all, ie. dynamic scoping of policy does not take place.

      This option is an SBCL-specific experimental extension: Interface
      subject to change.

  :SOURCE-NAMESTRING Namestring-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Namestring-Form to the internal
      debug-source information as the namestring of the source file. Normally
      the namestring of the input-file for COMPILE-FILE is used: this option
      can be used to provide source-file information for functions compiled
      using COMPILE, or to override the input-file of COMPILE-FILE.

      If both an outer and an inner WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT provide a
      SOURCE-NAMESTRING, the inner one takes precedence. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

  :SOURCE-PLIST Plist-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Plist-Form to internal debug-source
      information of functions compiled in within the dynamic extent of BODY.

      Primarily for use by development environments, in order to eg. associate
      function definitions with editor-buffers. Can be accessed using
      SB-INTROSPECT:DEFINITION-SOURCE-PLIST.

      If an outer WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form also provide a SOURCE-PLIST, it
      is appended to the end of the provided SOURCE-PLIST. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

Examples:

  ;; Prevent proclamations from the file leaking, and restrict
  ;; SAFETY to 3 -- otherwise uses the current global policy.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize))
    (restrict-compiler-policy 'safety 3)
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

  ;; Using default policy instead of the current global one,
  ;; except for DEBUG 3.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize debug)
                          :override t)
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

  ;; Same as if :POLICY had not been specified at all: SAFETY 3
  ;; proclamation leaks out from WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy nil)
    (declaim (optimize safety))
    (load \"foo.lisp\"))

  :PRINT
     If true, a message per non-macroexpanded top level form is printed
     to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*. Top level forms that whose subforms are
     processed as top level forms (eg. EVAL-WHEN, MACROLET, PROGN) receive
     no such message, but their subforms do.

     As an extension to ANSI, if :PRINT is :top-level-forms, a message
     per top level form after macroexpansion is printed to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.
     For example, compiling an IN-PACKAGE form will result in a message about
     a top level SETQ in addition to the message about the IN-PACKAGE form'
     itself.

     Both forms of reporting obey the SB-EXT:*COMPILER-PRINT-VARIABLE-ALIST*.

  :BLOCK-COMPILE
     Though COMPILE-FILE accepts an additional :BLOCK-COMPILE
     argument, it is not currently supported. (non-standard)

  :TRACE-FILE
     If given, internal data structures are dumped to the specified
     file, or if a value of T is given, to a file of *.trace type
     derived from the input file name. (non-standard)

  :EMIT-CFASL
     (Experimental). If true, outputs the toplevel compile-time effects
     of this file into a separate .cfasl file."
;;; Block compilation is currently broken.
#|
  "Also, as a workaround for vaguely-non-ANSI behavior, the
:BLOCK-COMPILE argument is quasi-supported, to determine whether
multiple functions are compiled together as a unit, resolving function
references at compile time. NIL means that global function names are
never resolved at compilation time. Currently NIL is the default
behavior, because although section 3.2.2.3, \"Semantic Constraints\",
of the ANSI spec allows this behavior under all circumstances, the
compiler's runtime scales badly when it tries to do this for large
files. If/when this performance problem is fixed, the block
compilation default behavior will probably be made dependent on the
SPEED and COMPILATION-SPEED optimization values, and the
:BLOCK-COMPILE argument will probably become deprecated."

;;;; MAKE-LOAD-FORM stuff

;;; The entry point for MAKE-LOAD-FORM support. When IR1 conversion
;;; finds a constant structure, it invokes this to arrange for proper
;;; dumping. If it turns out that the constant has already been
;;; dumped, then we don't need to do anything.
;;;
;;; If the constant hasn't been dumped, then we check to see whether
;;; we are in the process of creating it. We detect this by
;;; maintaining the special *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* as a list of all
;;; the constants we are in the process of creating. Actually, each
;;; entry is a list of the constant and any init forms that need to be
;;; processed on behalf of that constant.
;;;
;;; It's not necessarily an error for this to happen. If we are
;;; processing the init form for some object that showed up *after*
;;; the original reference to this constant, then we just need to
;;; defer the processing of that init form. To detect this, we
;;; maintain *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* as a list of the
;;; constants created since the last time we started processing an
;;; init form. If the constant passed to emit-make-load-form shows up
;;; in this list, then there is a circular chain through creation
;;; forms, which is an error.
;;;
;;; If there is some intervening init form, then we blow out of
;;; processing it by throwing to the tag PENDING-INIT. The value we
;;; throw is the entry from *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*. This is so the
;;; offending init form can be tacked onto the init forms for the
;;; circular object.
;;;
;;; If the constant doesn't show up in *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED*, then
;;; we have to create it. We call %MAKE-LOAD-FORM and check
;;; if the result is 'FOP-STRUCT, and if so we don't do anything.
;;; The dumper will eventually get its hands on the object and use the
;;; normal structure dumping noise on it.
;;;
;;; Otherwise, we bind *CONSTANTS-BEING-CREATED* and
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE- LAST-INIT* and compile the creation form
;;; much the way LOAD-TIME-VALUE does. When this finishes, we tell the
;;; dumper to use that result instead whenever it sees this constant.
;;;
;;; Now we try to compile the init form. We bind
;;; *CONSTANTS-CREATED-SINCE-LAST-INIT* to NIL and compile the init
;;; form (and any init forms that were added because of circularity
;;; detection). If this works, great. If not, we add the init forms to
;;; the init forms for the object that caused the problems and let it
;;; deal with it.
