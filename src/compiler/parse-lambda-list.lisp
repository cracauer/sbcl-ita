;;; customary left-to-right evaluation order of source forms as written.
;;; The new scheme seems more in accordance with other Lisp implementations.
;;; Portable code should probably not rely on the order in which structural
;;; errors are tested for. If input is well-formed - it matches the template -
;;; then there is no possibility of user code sensing the order in which
;;; well-formedness tests ran.
