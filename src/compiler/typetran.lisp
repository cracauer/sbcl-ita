;;;; type predicate translation
;;;;
;;;; We maintain a bidirectional association between type predicates
;;;; and the tested type. The presence of a predicate in this
;;;; association implies that it is desirable to implement tests of
;;;; this type using the predicate. These are either predicates that
;;;; the back end is likely to have special knowledge about, or
;;;; predicates so complex that the only reasonable implentation is
;;;; via function call.
;;;;
;;;; Some standard types (such as ATOM) are best tested by letting the
;;;; TYPEP source transform do its thing with the expansion. These
;;;; types (and corresponding predicates) are not maintained in this
;;;; association. In this case, there need not be any predicate
;;;; function unless it is required by the Common Lisp specification.
;;;;
;;;; The mapping between predicates and type structures is considered
;;;; part of the backend; different backends can support different
;;;; sets of predicates.

;;; Establish an association between the type predicate NAME and the
;;; corresponding TYPE. This causes the type predicate to be
;;; recognized for purposes of optimization.

;;; successfully when a constant type is discovered. We don't give an
;;; efficiency note when we pass, since the IR1 transform will give
;;; one if necessary and appropriate.

;;; If the type is TYPE= to a type that has a predicate, then expand
