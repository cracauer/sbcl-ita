;;;; full call
;;;
;;; There is something of a cross-product effect with full calls.
;;; Different versions are used depending on whether we know the
;;; number of arguments or the name of the called function, and
;;; whether we want fixed values, unknown values, or a tail call.
;;;
;;; In full call, the arguments are passed creating a partial frame on
;;; the stack top and storing stack arguments into that frame. On
;;; entry to the callee, this partial frame is pointed to by FP.

;;; This macro helps in the definition of full call VOPs by avoiding
;;; code replication in defining the cross-product VOPs.
;;;
;;; NAME is the name of the VOP to define.
;;;
;;; NAMED is true if the first argument is an fdefinition object whose
;;; definition is to be called.
;;;
;;; RETURN is either :FIXED, :UNKNOWN or :TAIL:
;;; -- If :FIXED, then the call is for a fixed number of values, returned in
;;;    the standard passing locations (passed as result operands).
;;; -- If :UNKNOWN, then the result values are pushed on the stack, and the
;;;    result values are specified by the Start and Count as in the
;;;    unknown-values continuation representation.
;;; -- If :TAIL, then do a tail-recursive call. No values are returned.
;;;    The Old-Fp and Return-PC are passed as the second and third arguments.
;;;
;;; In non-tail calls, the pointer to the stack arguments is passed as
;;; the last fixed argument. If Variable is false, then the passing
;;; locations are passed as a more arg. Variable is true if there are
;;; a variable number of arguments passed on the stack. Variable
;;; cannot be specified with :TAIL return. TR variable argument call
;;; is implemented separately.
;;;
;;; In tail call with fixed arguments, the passing locations are
;;; passed as a more arg, but there is no new-FP, since the arguments
;;; have been set up in the current frame.
