The CommonLoops evaluator is meta-circular.

Most of the code in PCL is methods on generic functions, including
most of the code that actually implements generic functions and method
lookup.

So, we have a classic bootstrapping problem. The solution to this is
to first get a cheap implementation of generic functions running,
these are called early generic functions. These early generic
functions and the corresponding early methods and early method lookup
are used to get enough of the system running that it is possible to
create real generic functions and methods and implement real method
lookup. At that point (done in the file FIXUP) the function
!FIX-EARLY-GENERIC-FUNCTIONS is called to convert all the early generic
functions to real generic functions.

The cheap generic functions are built using the same
FUNCALLABLE-INSTANCE objects that real generic functions are made out of.
This means that as PCL is being bootstrapped, the cheap generic
function objects which are being created are the same objects which
will later be real generic functions. This is good because:
  - we don't cons garbage structure, and
  - we can keep pointers to the cheap generic function objects
    during booting because those pointers will still point to
    the right object after the generic functions are all fixed up.

This file defines the DEFMETHOD macro and the mechanism used to expand
it. This includes the mechanism for processing the body of a method.
DEFMETHOD basically expands into a call to LOAD-DEFMETHOD, which
basically calls ADD-METHOD to add the method to the generic function.
These expansions can be loaded either during bootstrapping or when PCL
is fully up and running.

An important effect of this arrangement is it means we can compile
files with DEFMETHOD forms in them in a completely running PCL, but
then load those files back in during bootstrapping. This makes
development easier. It also means there is only one set of code for
processing DEFMETHOD. Bootstrapping works by being sure to have
LOAD-METHOD be careful to call only primitives which work during
bootstrapping.

;;; CMUCL comment (Gerd Moellmann):
;;;
;;; The standard says it's an error if CALL-NEXT-METHOD is called with
;;; arguments, and the set of methods applicable to those arguments is
;;; different from the set of methods applicable to the original
;;; method arguments.  (According to Barry Margolin, this rule was
;;; probably added to ensure that before and around methods are always
;;; run before primary methods.)
;;;
;;; This could be optimized for the case that the generic function
;;; doesn't have hairy methods, does have standard method combination,
;;; is a standard generic function, there are no methods defined on it
;;; for COMPUTE-APPLICABLE-METHODS and probably a lot more of such
;;; preconditions.  That looks hairy and is probably not worth it,
;;; because this check will never be fast.
