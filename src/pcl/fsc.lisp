;;;; This file contains the definition of the FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS
;;;; metaclass. Much of the implementation of this metaclass is actually
;;;; defined on the class STD-CLASS. What appears in this file is a modest
;;;; number of simple methods related to the low-level differences in the
;;;; implementation of standard and funcallable-standard instances.
;;;;
;;;; As it happens, none of these differences are the ones reflected in
;;;; the MOP specification; STANDARD-CLASS and FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS
;;;; share all their specified methods at STD-CLASS.
