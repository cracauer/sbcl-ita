;;;; FINDING SLOT DEFINITIONS
;;;
;;; Historical PCL found slot definitions by iterating over
;;; CLASS-SLOTS, which is O(N) for number of slots, and moreover
;;; requires a GF call (for SLOT-DEFINITION-NAME) for each slot in
;;; list up to the desired one.
;;;
;;; Current SBCL hashes the effective slot definitions, and some
;;; information pulled out from them into a simple-vector, with bucket
;;; chains made out of plists keyed by the slot names. This fixes
;;; gives O(1) performance, and avoid the GF calls.
;;;
;;; MAKE-SLOT-TABLE constructs the hashed vector out of a list of
;;; effective slot definitions and the class they pertain to, and
;;; FIND-SLOT-DEFINITION knows how to look up slots in that vector.
;;;
;;; The only bit of cleverness in the implementation is to make the
;;; vectors fairly tight, but always longer then 0 elements:
;;;
;;; -- We don't want to waste huge amounts of space no these vectors,
;;;    which are mostly required by things like SLOT-VALUE with a
;;;    variable slot name, so a constant extension over the minimum
;;;    size seems like a good choise.
;;;
;;; -- As long as the vector always has a length > 0
;;;    FIND-SLOT-DEFINITION doesn't need to handle the rare case of an
;;;    empty vector separately: it just returns a NIL.
;;;
;;; In addition to the slot-definition we also store the slot-location
;;; and type-check function for instances of standard metaclasses, so
;;; that SLOT-VALUE &co using variable slot names can get at them
;;; without additional GF calls.
;;;
;;; Notes:
;;;   It would also be nice to have STANDARD-INSTANCE-STRUCTURE-P
;;;   generic instead of checking versus STANDARD-CLASS and
;;;   FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS.
;;;
;;;   Uh, the comments above talking about how FIND-SLOT-DEFINITION
;;;   does something with slot vectors has no basis in reality.
;;;   Probably the comments need fixing, rather than the code.
