;;; DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION
;;; When two methods are in the same method group and have the same
;;; specializers, their sort order within the group may be ambiguous. Therefore,
;;; we should throw an error when we have two methods in the same group with
;;; the same specializers /as long as/ we have more than one method group
;;; or our single method group qualifier-pattern is not *. This resolves the
;;; apparent conflict with the above 'It is also possible to bypass' language.
;;;
;;; The language specifying this behavior is:
;;; "Note that two methods with identical specializers, but with different
;;; qualifiers, are not ordered by the algorithm described in Step 2 of the
;;; method selection and combination process described in Section 7.6.6
;;; (Method Selection and Combination). Normally the two methods play different
;;; roles in the effective method because they have different qualifiers, and
;;; no matter how they are ordered in the result of Step 2, the effective
;;; method is the same. If the two methods play the same role and their order
;;; matters, an error is signaled. This happens as part of the qualifier
;;; pattern matching in define-method-combination."

;; First we ensure that it fails correctly when there is more than one
