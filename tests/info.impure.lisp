;;;; tests of the INFO/globaldb system
;;;;
;;;; KLUDGE: Unlike most of the system's tests, these are not in the
;;;; problem domain, but in the implementation domain, so modification
;;;; of the system could cause these tests to fail even if the system
;;;; was still a correct implementation of ANSI Common Lisp + SBCL
;;;; extensions. Perhaps such tests should be separate from tests in
;;;; the problem domain. -- WHN 2001-02-11

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.
;;;;
;;;; While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test
;;;; files (like this one) were written from scratch after the fork
;;;; from CMU CL.

;;;; This software is in the public domain and is provided with
;;;; absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING and CREDITS files for
